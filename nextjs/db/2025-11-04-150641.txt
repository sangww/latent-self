Korean man, thirty-nine, medium closeup, wearing a faded charcoal trench coat with reflective seam piping, standing under a rain-soaked neon overpass at dusk. He cradles a palm-sized mechanical compass drone — brass gears, glass lens, and a soft amber pilot light — its tiny rotors paused. Wet asphalt reflects teal and magenta signs of a retro-future courier district. Filmic grain, Kodak Portra tones, shallow depth with bokeh streetlights, framing like a Wes Anderson composition with Spielberg warmth and Black Mirror unease. He looks just off-frame, rain on his hair, expression unreadable, candid social-photo vibe, muted contrast, cinematic, photorealistic, longing and quiet determination.
