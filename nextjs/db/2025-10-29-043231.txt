Korean man in a black mirror dystopia, medium close-up: a translucent subdermal notification lattice spiderwebbing across his temple and cheek, tiny holographic icons frozen like insects. He wears a scuffed corporate smart-suit with warm amber LED seams and a loosened collar. He looks slightly away from camera, cigarette smoke curling, neon rain reflecting on glassy skin. Composition inspired by Ridley Scott's neo-noir and Tarkovsky's slow surrealism, photographic analog grain, moody high-contrast lighting, deep shadows, saturated cyan and amber palette, razor-sharp facial detail, shallow depth of field, cinematic vignette, evocative, unsettlingly ordinary future, subtle wet reflections and tactile skin microtextures visible.
