Korean man in a faded polyester leisure suit sits in a retro 1970s living room, medium close-up, profile, hands adjusting a chrome reel-to-reel tape deck. The wallpaper's floral pattern subtly ripples into miniature, photorealistic cityscapes; the lampshade casts a maplike glow. Warm ochre and teal tones, film grain, shallow depth of field, analog color negative look. Surrealist retro minimalism, cinematic framing with symmetrical off-center composition inspired by meticulous set design. The mood is quiet, uncanny and domestic—paper shadows, dust motes in sunlight—photorealistic analog photograph, soft contrast, tactile textures, slightly desaturated highlights. subtle film flare and muted reflections, and quiet nostalgia.
