Korean man, 45-year-old maintenance technician in a weathered gray jumpsuit, stands in robotic urbanity beneath bioluminescent neon vines that braid chrome facades and release micro-drones like fireflies. He adjusts a humming holographic valve at chest height, medium close-up, profile, eyes focused past frame. Photorealistic analog photograph: warm Kodak film tones, gentle grain, shallow depth of field, rim-lit with neon reflections. Surrealism influenced by Ridley Scott cinematic light and Tarkovskian mood: lonely, clinical, uncanny. Composition balances human skin texture against reflective metal and soft organic glow, bold color accents, subtle motion blur on drifting drones, and faint distant sirens echoing softly.
