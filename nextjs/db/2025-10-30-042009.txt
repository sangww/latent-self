Korean man, 40s, wearing a worn reflective moto jacket with stitched circuitry, medium close-up in an ubertechnological urban landscape; he cups a drifting holographic koi from a street-side neon basin â€” a single translucent fish emitting soft cyan and amber bioluminescence. Behind him, towering glass monorails and holographic ads blur into shallow depth of field. faint rain falling. Analog film grain, warm tungsten highlights, and saturated neon contrast create cinematic neo-noir, Ridley Scott inspiration. Moody rim light sculpts his profile as he studies the koi, cigarette smoke curling; tactile textures, realistic skin pores, filmic color grading, 35mm lens, imperfect framing.
