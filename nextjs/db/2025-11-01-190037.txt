Korean man, late-30s watchmaker in a grease-stained denim apron, sits in a robot-modern home kitchen where polished chrome appliances fold into furniture. He adjusts a tiny clockwork household automaton with a jeweler's screwdriver, medium close-up, profile, focused eyes, shallow depth of field. Surrounding him are transparent canisters of miniature engineered microclimates—tiny rain and wind circuits activated by visible gears—arranged like kitchen jars. Cinematic, surrealist composition with Wes Anderson symmetry and muted pastel palette, grainy 35mm analog film aesthetic, soft warm backlight, high contrast details, photorealistic, quietly uncanny, tactile fingerprints on metal, faint oil on his fingers, dust motes in frame.
