Korean man in a black mirror dystopia, medium-close portrait holding a glass-encased mechanical koi â€” a palm-sized chrome fish tank filled with micro-circuits and slow glowing liquid. He wears a worn leather motorcycle jacket lined with reflective circuitry, collar up. Three-quarter profile, eyes off-frame, fingers cradling the koi as if it breathes data. Analog film photorealism, Tarkovsky-meets-Ridley Scott neon-noir lighting, muted teal and amber palette, high grain, subtle film scratches, soft bokeh background of rain-streaked city screens. Bold composition, shallow depth of field, intimate, uncanny, quietly melancholic atmosphere, a single tear of oil reflecting neon, timeless, oddly human, quietly tender.
