Korean man in his early 40s wearing a worn denim jacket, set in a robot-modern home kitchen where chrome appliances and potted succulents nestle next to tidy mechanical tools. Medium closeup, three-quarter profile, hands delicately adjusting a small domestic service automaton's exposed brass gears on the counter, expression absorbed. Surrealist minimalism with Wes Anderson-inspired symmetry: muted pastels, warm film grain, precise framing. Photorealistic analog photography: Kodak Portra tones, shallow depth of field, soft backlight through blinds, reflective surfaces catching small specular highlights. Intimate, odd everyday futurism, quiet narrative tension, meticulous props, clean lines, subtle absurdity. Gentle, cinematic loneliness quietly pervades.
