Korean man in a post-industrial pastoral setting, medium close-up beside a moss-splattered rusting turbine blade that sprouts wild poppies; age 45, wearing a faded denim chore jacket, olive canvas trousers and leather gardening gloves, hands resting on soil-stained palms. He gazes past camera, profile half-lit by late golden hour sun, background soft with reclaimed factory silos turned bee-hives. Composition inspired by Tarkovskyâ€™s melancholic long-take realism with subtle Wes Anderson symmetry, rich film grain, warm desaturated palette, shallow depth of field, analog 35mm photorealism, tactile textures, slight lens flare, contemplative, quietly surreal atmosphere, a hint of rain-streaked glass and distant train.
