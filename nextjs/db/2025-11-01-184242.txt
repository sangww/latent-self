Korean man, retro alternative 60s street set, a 45-year-old tailor in a patched mod suit, medium close-up three-quarter profile adjusting a cuff where a brass pocket contraption cradles a miniature weather cloud, shops behind display chromatic rain curtains, surrealism with Wes Anderson symmetry, cinematic Kodak film grain, warm mustard and teal palette, soft backlight, shallow depth of field, analog lens flare, precise textures of wool and brass, quiet absurdism: he concentrates as tiny rain falls inside the cuff-cloud, pedestrians blurred, composition balanced, photorealistic, evocative, slightly uncanny. muted street sign reflections, vintage typography, subtle grainy contrast, timeless narrative presence, calmly framed.
