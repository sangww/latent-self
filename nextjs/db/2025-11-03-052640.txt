Korean man, mid-40s, in a soaked retro-futuristic seaside amusement park at golden hour: a derelict neon carousel reflected in puddles. He wears a mustard wool pea coat, angular sunglasses, vintage wristwatch, holding a scratched brass portable radio close to his chest. Medium close-up, three-quarter profile looking past the frame, rain on his hair, steam rising from asphalt. Cinematic analog 35mm film grain, warm tungsten rim light, deep color saturation, soft bokeh, symmetrical composition with subtle asymmetry; visual tone blending Wes Anderson precision and Wong Kar-wai melancholy with Spielbergian scope. Photorealistic, social-media candid aesthetic, evocative and slightly surreal, muted background motion.
