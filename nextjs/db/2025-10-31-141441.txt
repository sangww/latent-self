Korean man, 38, wearing a weathered synthetic-leather trench coat, stands in robotic urbanity: rain-slick angular alleyways lined with kinetic billboards and rusted monorail scaffolding. A mechanical pigeon perches on his gloved hand—brass gears, glass eye—while neon reflections smear across his jaw in an analog film grain close-up. He exhales smoke into the night, profile lit by emerald and magenta backlight, medium close-up composition, shallow depth of field. Photorealistic, neo-noir cinematic style blending Ridley Scott’s chiaroscuro and Wong Kar-wai’s saturated voyeuristic color, bold composition, tactile textures, 35mm film aesthetic, gritty futuristic everyday mood, subtle lens flare, selective focus on weathered hands.
