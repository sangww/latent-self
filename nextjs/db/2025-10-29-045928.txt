Korean man in a post-industrial pastoral setting, medium close-up beside a cracked glass terrarium dome filled with fog, tall meadow grasses and bioluminescent mushrooms. He wears a worn mechanic's trench coat with oil stains and embroidered wildflower patches. He presses his palm to the condensation, profile turned away, face half-reflected in curved glass. Warm tungsten rim light and cold neon seep through rusted steel frames. Photorealistic analog film grain, shallow depth, cinematic surrealism inspired by Tarkovsky and Ridley Scott â€” melancholic, hyper-detailed tones, muted greens with saturated cyan highlights, careful framing, soft bokeh background, film-streaked flares and subtle lens imperfections.
