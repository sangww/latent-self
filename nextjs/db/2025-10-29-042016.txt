Korean man in a retro-futurism rain-soaked alley, medium closeup, cradling a transparent mechanical koi suspended in a glass aquarium sphere, neon reflections fracture his features. He wears a tailored silver pea coat with luminescent teal piping and a charcoal turtleneck, collar turned up. Composition off-center, shallow depth of field, film grain, muted color palette punctured by saturated cyan and magenta highlights. Surrealism with Tarkovsky-inspired long-exposure textures and Ridley Scott neon noir atmosphere, cinematic rim light, tactile wet surfaces, subtle motion blur from falling rain, quiet intensity, ambiguous expression, looking slightly past the frame. Analog Kodak Portra warmth, soft contrast, grain.
