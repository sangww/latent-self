Korean man in his late thirties stands in a flooded subway station of a retro-future city, medium shot framed hip-to-chest. He wears a water-stained wool overcoat patched with luminous moss panels and a crisp white shirt, sleeves rolled, fingers wrapped around a steaming tin mug. Above him, suspended solar-lantern jellyfish—translucent, pulsing with teal and amber bioluminescence—reflect in rippling tile. Photorealistic film portrait with 35mm grain, warm Kodak Portra tones, shallow depth of field, bold contrast, soft rim light catching droplets, slightly tilted composition, everyday poise against absurd infrastructure, quiet, defiant expression, cinematic analog nostalgia, muted electric hum and distant train.
