Korean man in an ubertechnological robotic urbanity: medium close-up of a 35-year-old wearing a battered, oil-stained leather jacket layered over a silver woven synth-shirt and tailored black trousers, fingers tracing a luminous, bio-glass metro-rail module — a miniature autonomous transit globe suspended mid-air, internal neon moss pulsing — cityscape reflections in rain-speckled window behind. Cinematic, Ridley Scott–inspired neo-noir, high-contrast analog film grain, warm tungsten highlights and teal shadows, shallow depth of field, slightly off-center composition, contemplative profile, ambient servo hum implied, photorealistic, bold color grading, tactile texture, intimate futuristic realism. Analog chemical scent remembered, subtle lens flares, rain on glass.
