Korean man, 34, medium close up on a rooftop market at twilight, rain sheen concrete, neon signs bleeding into puddles. He wears a vintage brown windbreaker over a crisp white shirt, tousled hair, small retro augmented eyepiece over left brow, holding an analog radio against his chest, gaze averted. Background: stacked solar panels, rusted mechanical cranes, mismatched flock of weathered kites tethered to wire, distant monorail streak. Soft cinematic color grading, symmetrical composition, warm teal orange contrast, cinematic lens flare, depth of field, grainy film emulation, social media candid vibe inspired by Wes Anderson and Black Mirror, urban mystique mood.
