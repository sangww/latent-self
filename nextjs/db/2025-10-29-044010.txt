Korean man in a cyborgs and androids street scene, medium closeup three-quarter profile, wearing a worn leather trench coat with fiber-optic stitching, cradling a chrome hummingbird with exposed gears perched on his prosthetic hand. His gaze is soft, not looking at camera; shallow depth of field isolates him from rain-slick neon alleys and holographic signage. Photorealistic analog photography, cinematic neo-noir inspired by Ridley Scott: soft film grain, warm tungsten highlights and cold cyan rim light, subtle lens flare, tactile skin texture, muted palette punctuated by saturated magenta and teal accents, intimate composition, eerily familiar yet futuristic and cinematic color grading.
