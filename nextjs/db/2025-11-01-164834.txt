Korean man, retro 1970s street at golden hour, skyline studded with giant pocket watches embedded in brick facades whose hands move in reverse; a 35 year old cinematographer in a worn suede jacket and silk scarf, medium close up three quarter profile, adjusting a vintage light meter with fingers, cigarette ember glint; composition evokes Wes Anderson symmetry but off center, surrealist undertone, saturated 70s analog film colors, halation, pronounced grain, photorealistic analog photography, warm orange teal contrast, wardrobe texture, cinematic depth of field, slight lens flare, reflections of reversed clock hands on polished meter glass, subtle nostalgia, faint city haze.
