Korean man in a retro alternative 1970s living room, wearing a tailored mustard suit and thin turtleneck, forty-something, medium-close shot. He holds a levitating brass pocket watch with exposed gears suspended above his palm, tiny mechanical moths circling the mechanism. Warm muted palette, precise symmetry and quirky framing inspired by Wes Anderson, cinematic Spielbergian lens flare, analog film grain, Kodak Portra tones. Soft window light from left, shallow depth of field, subtle dust motes, faded wallpaper and a rotary phone out of focus behind him. Photorealistic, slightly absurd, everyday surrealism, composed like a still from an uncanny domestic period drama.
