Korean man, 35-year-old, medium closeup social feed portrait: leaning against rain-slick chrome railing on a rooftop greenhouse beside a silent maglev loop, matte titanium maintenance drone perched on his shoulder like a stray cat. He wears a retro-futuristic bomber jacket, tailored collar up, hands relaxed, half-turned gaze away from lens. Twilight drizzle, neon reflections, cinematic shallow depth of field, Kodachrome film grain, warm Spielberg lighting with Wes Anderson symmetry and Black Mirror unease. Analog 35mm portrait, candid but composed, subtle scar of circuitry along temple, soft bokeh cityscape with distant glowing transit pylons, intimate, uncanny, everyday futurism. shareable mood piece.
