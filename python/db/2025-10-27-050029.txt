A 30-year-old Korean man with tousled black hair, wearing a vintage bomber jacket and a faded graphic tee, stands in a bustling retro-futuristic cityscape. Neon signs in Hangul flicker in the background, casting a soft glow on his face, revealing a contemplative expression. He holds a holographic device displaying a map of the city, showcasing an alternate 1980s where technology advanced differently. The shot focuses closely on his upper body, slightly turned away from the camera, emphasizing the intricate details of his outfit against the vibrant, bustling street life. The lighting is warm and nostalgic, reminiscent of analog photography.
