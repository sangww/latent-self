Korean man, age 45, in a robot modern home: medium-shot, he sits at a lacquered kitchenette island under a soft teal skylight, handling a pocket-sized swarm of brass housekeeping drones — tiny clockwork beetles with polished lenses — arranging them like delicate tools. He wears a worn gray mechanic's jacket and a thin silver ring. The walls are seamless matte ceramic embedded with retracting chrome conduits and potted sculptural ferns. Photorealistic analog photography, surrealist cinematic minimalism inspired by Wes Anderson: precise symmetry, saturated pastels, shallow depth of field, warm film grain, bold framing, quiet domestic strangeness, calm, slightly uncanny atmosphere.
