Korean man in a post-modern minimalistic rooftop studio, an architect surrounded by small floating brass-blueprint sheets animated by clockwork, medium closeup three-quarter profile, adjusting a levitating draft with a gentle thumb, Kodachrome analog film grain and warm pastel palette, Wes Anderson-inspired symmetry and cinematic rim light, photorealistic textures of skin, linen and brushed metal, shallow depth of field, bold yet understated color grading, subtle dust motes and light leaks, precise reflections on brass, uncanny ordinary atmosphere, filmic composition, slight anamorphic flare, soft window light, a muted ceramic vase on concrete table, graphite smudges on fingers, quiet focused expression and calm.
