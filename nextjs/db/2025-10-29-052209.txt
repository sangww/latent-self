Korean man in an ubertechnological urban landscape, medium close-up, three-quarter profile. He is 34, wearing a tailored charcoal trench coat with subtle carbon-fiber lapels and a single silver cuff. He cradles a suspended glass terrarium: a neon bonsai tree emitting soft cyan and magenta bioluminescence, wires like veins. Analog film grain, shallow depth of field, rich cinematic contrast. Composition inspired by neo-noir minimalism and Ridley Scottâ€™s futuristic palettes: reflective wet pavement, distant holographic traffic. Moody rim lighting sculpts his jawline; he adjusts a delicate holographic leaf with a gloved fingertip, focused, contemplative, photorealistic. warm highlights, muted grain, cinematic framing, intentional.
