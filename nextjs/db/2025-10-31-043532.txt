Korean man in a neo-modern minimalistic apartment, medium shot, seated at a low concrete table beside a shallow reflective basin, glass orbs drifting like modern decor. He is 42, wearing a bronze tailored jacket, crisp black turtleneck, and matte silver wrist cuff. He reaches out, fingertips skimming holographic ivy that unfurls like liquid light. Analog film grain, warm tungsten highlights, symmetrical composition, shallow depth of field, soft vignette. Color palette: muted ochres, teal, and copper. Photorealistic, cinematic minimalism inspired by Wes Anderson, quiet intensity, deliberate framing, evocative silence. Subtle reflections ripple on glass, a distant city hum under low thrum.
