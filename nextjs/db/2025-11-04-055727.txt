Korean man in his early thirties, wearing a rumpled mustard overcoat and modular utility vest, medium close-up, leaning on a rain-slicked polymer bench beneath a sky-tractor tramline. He cradles a transparent data-jar pulsing soft amber light—an obsolete city memory drive—fingers stained with petrol; eyes half-turned from lens, introspective. Neon signage and suspended windmills blur into a shallow, grainy 35mm film aesthetic, golden hour with drizzle. Social-media candid vibe, cinematic framing inspired by Wes Anderson symmetry and Black Mirror unease, high-contrast color grading, tactile film grain, natural bounce light reflecting from wet asphalt, subtle motion blur on passing mag-rail. urban decay.
