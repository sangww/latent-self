Korean man in a black-mirror dystopia, medium close-up under a flickering neon overpass, clutching a shattered holographic umbrella made of glass-like AR shards. He wears a charcoal, tailored tech-trench with thin luminous seams and a collar upturned against acid rain. His face is lit from the side by rain-reflected advertisements; he looks past the frame, gaze detached. The background shows blurred vertical screens and dripping concrete, pixels smearing into puddles. Photorealistic analog film aesthetic, high grain, shallow depth of field, muted cyan-magenta palette, cinematic lighting inspired by Ridley Scott and Tarkovsky, tense, intimate composition. low-key drama, subtle reflective puddle glow.
