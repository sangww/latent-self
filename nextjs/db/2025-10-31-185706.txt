Korean man in a robotic urbanity setting, a 45-year-old maintenance engineer in a patched flight jacket, medium close-up as he inspects a scrap-chrome polymer courier bird perched on his gloved hand. Rain-slick alley background with stacked vending towers and conveyor belts, soft neon signs bleeding into puddles. Ridley Scottâ€“inspired neo-noir photorealism, cinematic tungsten highlights and cool neon rim light, shallow depth of field, subtle film grain, Kodak Portra tones, high dynamic range analog contrast, intimate composition, off-camera gaze, strong texture on leather and metal, muted palette punctured by saturated color accents. cinematic vignette framing evokes quiet industrial melancholy and patience.
