Korean man in a post-industrial serenity rooftop garden where abandoned factories breathe quiet; glass chimneys and vine-wrapped conveyor belts form soft geometry. A floating metallic koi sculpture arcs above corroded water tanks (world element). He wears a patched denim jacket. Medium close-up, three-quarter profile, adjusting an antique film camera with oily fingerprints, shallow depth of field. Surrealist, Tarkovsky-inspired cinematic lighting: long, muted shadows, silver halide grain, warm tungsten highlights, cool window light rim. Photoreal analog photograph, slightly bold color grading, intimate atmosphere, tactile rust textures, subtle lens flare, quiet humanity. nostalgic smoke wisping, distant monorail silhouettes, faded signage, cracked billboards.
