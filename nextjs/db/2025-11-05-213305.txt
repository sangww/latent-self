Korean man, mid-30s, medium close-up in analog film portrait style: rain-slicked neon alley at twilight, cinematic Wes Anderson framing with Spielberg warmth and Black Mirror edge. He wears a faded denim jacket patched with micro-LED embroidery, leaning against a subway pillar, looking off-frame, expression subtle, candid social-media vibe. Prominent speculative tech: a transparent retinal implant glowing faintly at the iris junction and a matte titanium earpiece with tiny projected interface lines on his cheek. Soft film grain, shallow depth of field, Kodak Portra tones, warm highlights, cool shadows, natural rain droplets on skin, reflective wet pavement bokeh, urban nocturnal melancholy.
