Korean man in his mid-30s, medium close-up, inside a derelict 1970s road diner remade as a future botanical archive: chrome booths, analog TV consoles, potted glass cacti, and a parking-lot sky patched with neon ribbons. He wears a faded mustard blazer over a thin turtleneck, holding a steaming metal thermos, eyes looking past camera. Film-grain Kodak Portra aesthetic, warm tungsten rim light, shallow depth of field, symmetrical composition inspired by Wes Anderson with Spielbergian soft backlight and Black Mirror uncanny detail. Capture an Instagram-story candid feel—nostalgic, slightly surreal, intimate, tactile, cinematic, photorealistic analog photograph shot on vintage 35mm film, grainy.
