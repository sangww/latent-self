Korean man in his early 40s, retro alternative 1960s street scene outside a mustard-painted caf√©, wearing a worn suede jacket and narrow tie, holds a pocket-sized mechanical weather orchestrator with brass valves and glass tubes puffing miniature rain and snow at waist level. Medium-close shot, three-quarter profile, eyes looking past the frame as he delicately adjusts a valve with ink-stained fingers. Surrealism, inspired by Wes Anderson color-blocking: saturated teals, ochres, deep maroons, strong symmetry, analog film grain, shallow depth of field, soft backlight, bold composition, photorealistic texture and quiet absurdity. Warm rim light, faint film scratches and subtle lens flares.
