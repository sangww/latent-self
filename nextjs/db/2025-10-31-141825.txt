Korean man, age 38, in robotic urbanity: a rain-slick alley threaded with braided neon cables and suspended vending arcades, towering rusted service arms folding above. He is medium close-up, three-quarter profile, filmic grain, Kodak Portra tones, shallow depth of field. He wears a worn charcoal parka and oil-stained gloves; his face lit by cool cyan and warm amber reflections from autonomous tramlines overhead. A mechanical crow perches on a nearby conduit, its silhouette blurred. Neo-noir, cinematic aesthetic inspired by Ridley Scott, analog 35mm photography, high contrast, subtle motion blur, intimate yet uncanny urban stillness. rain droplets frozen, glinting like circuitry.
