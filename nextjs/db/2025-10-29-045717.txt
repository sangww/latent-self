Korean man in a post-industrial pastoral landscape cradles a small clockwork lamb—brass gears, moss, tiny glass eyes—against a backdrop of rusting silos overgrown with wildflowers. He wears an olive waxed chore coat patched with embroidered floral seams and frayed denim, gloves stained with oil and soil. Medium close-up, three-quarter profile, hands centered, wind lifting stray hair. Photorealistic analog photograph: Kodak Portra tones, visible grain, shallow depth of field, warm golden-hour rim light, bold but natural color. Surrealism meets Tarkovsky-like melancholic framing: uncanny everyday ritual, cinematic, intimate, slightly uncanny. Lens flare, subtle dust motes, muted teal shadows, reflective oil sheen, quietly.
