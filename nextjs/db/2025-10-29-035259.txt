Korean man stands in a rain-slick technopunk alley, wearing layered streetwear—oversized neon-stitched jacket, tapered cargo pants, scuffed skate shoes—cradling a cobalt-glass field recorder with a visible luminescent filament and brass dials, his thumb pausing on a glowing node. He adjusts a delicate crank while leaning against a graffiti-scoured concrete wall; medium close-up three-quarter profile shot from waist height, analog film grain, shallow depth of field, warm tungsten key light with cool cyan rim, saturated yet gritty colors, slight light leak and emulsion scratches, candid documentary composition, bold contrast, focus on textured skin, weathered hands, and soft eerie glow of device.
