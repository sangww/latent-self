Korean man in his late 40s, wearing a matte-black tailored jumpsuit, stands in a neo-modern hyper-minimalistic apartment. Medium close-up, three-quarter profile, he gently cradles a levitating glass orb containing a miniature neon skyline and a slow silver confetti storm. Soft golden rim light sculpts his jaw, muted pastel walls and a single chrome chair recede into negative space. Photorealistic analog photography feel, grainy film texture, shallow depth of field, warm color cast. Surrealism with precise symmetry hints of Wes Anderson and Ridley Scott-inspired cinematic lighting, quiet, uncanny intimacy, bold yet restrained composition, smoky film bleed, subtle lens flare accents, delicately.
