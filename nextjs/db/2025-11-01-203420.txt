Korean man in a robot-modern home, wearing a worn denim work jacket, medium shot at a sunlit kitchen island. The walls hold patchwork analog clocks with brass gears exposed; he sits at the counter, carefully turning a tiny brass gear with a jeweler's screwdriver. Composition symmetrical yet slightly off-center; palette of pastel mustard and teal, uncanny domestic quiet. Photorealistic analog film aesthetic — Kodak Portra 400, 50mm, shallow depth of field, soft grain — inspired by Wes Anderson symmetry and Black Mirror unease, warm backlight and subtle flare, shot like a 1970s family portrait, crisp highlights, long shadows, tactile textures.
