Korean man, early 40s, cropped medium-shot portrait in moody golden-hour rain on an elevated urban rooftop. He wears a patched leather bomber over a muted turtleneck, leaning casually against a neon-debugged transit kiosk, cradling a scratched mechanical pager-like device that projects thin paper maps. He glances off-frame, expression tiredly empathetic. Background: retro-futuristic highway with autonomous trams and aluminum wind sculptures, wet reflections and bokeh. Style: cinematic symmetry, pastel palette, meticulous framing inspired by Wes Anderson with Spielberg warmth and Black Mirror tension. Photorealistic analog film grain, shallow depth of field, high dynamic range, social-media candid aesthetic. subtle neon rim light.
