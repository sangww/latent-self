Korean man, age 45, medium-shot in a post-industrial pastoral at golden hour: he wears a weathered leather jacket over a linen shirt, faded denim, and work gloves. He leans against a rusted windmill—an oversized brass gearwindmill entwined with ivy—one hand tracing a cog, eyes half-closed. Background: tall wild grasses, scattered shipping-container greenhouses, distant factory silhouettes. Photorealistic analog film aesthetic, shallow depth of field, warm backlight, film grain, high dynamic range, subtle color cross-processing. Composition inspired by Tarkovsky mood and Ridley Scott detail, surreal quietness, bold framing, tactile textures, slightly desaturated greens and copper highlights, soft lens flare and subtle haze.
