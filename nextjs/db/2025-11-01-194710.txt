Korean man in a retro-alternative 1960s apartment, 39-year-old vintage radio repairman wearing a grease-stained corduroy cardigan and film camera strap, medium close-up, profile turned away from camera. He cradles a tiny tethered raincloud the size of an apple above his open palm, soft vapor and a single slow drop suspended. Warm analog film grain, saturated mustard and teal palette, meticulous symmetric composition, shallow depth of field. Surrealism with Wes Andersonâ€“like framing: everyday absurdity made ceremonial, precise lighting, cinematic lens flare, nostalgic texture, visible film sprocket edges, quiet human ritual in a slightly uncanny domestic world, slow ticking radio, distant jazz.
