Korean man, age 45, wearing a patched wool coat over a threadbare linen shirt and scuffed boots, in a post-industrial pastoral landscape: a rusted greenhouse roof over wild grass and scattered conveyor belts. He rests one hand on the muzzle of a brass mechanical stag with glowing filament veins. Medium shot, slightly off-center, he gazes past the frame; evening golden-hour backlight, film emulsion grain, shallow depth of field. Surrealism meets Tarkovsky and Ridley Scott â€” moody cyan-teal lift, warm sepia highlights, tactile analog photography, careful composition, bold color accents, photorealistic, quietly uncanny, soft creeping fog, reflective puddles in the foreground.
