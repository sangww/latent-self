Korean man, 42, stands in a narrow alley of a retro-futuristic district rewilded with bioluminescent moss, medium shot three-quarter profile as he inspects a living cybernetic forearm where brass gears entwine luminous mycelium veins. His tailored wool overcoat flutters; fingertips trace the soft fungal filaments that pulse faint cyan. The prosthetic's polished brass and grafted wood emit a warm patina against cool neon. Photographed on 35mm film with Kodak Portra palette, shallow depth of field, natural golden-hour rim light, grain and subtle light leaks; intimate, tactile skin texture, high detail, careful composition â€” familiar, quietly uncanny, slightly smiling at dusk.
