Korean man, 38, medium-shot vertical story portrait in an abandoned retro-futuristic subway turned botanical workshop, moss-grown chrome rails, giant mechanical sunflowers and rusted vending machines with analog CRT displays; he leans on a dented stainless dispenser, holding a steaming paper cup, glancing sideways, expression half-wry, half-wonder. Outfit: faded brown leather jacket, mustard turtleneck, worn denim. Surreal contrast: stray neon signage, small delivery drone docked like a pet, sunbeams slicing dust. Cinematic, Wes Anderson symmetry meets Black Mirror oddity; photorealistic analog film aesthetic, Kodak Portra tones, shallow depth, grain, high dynamic range, social-media story framing, candid mood, soft backlight, quiet tension.
