Korean man in a robotic urbanity setting, neon rain-slick alley filled with suspended vending drones and drifting holographic koi. He is 38, wearing a tailored silver trench coat and faded charcoal turtleneck, medium close-up turning three-quarters away from camera, fingertips cupping a tiny mechanical bird that glows blue. Analog film grain, shallow depth of field, warm tungsten highlights and cool cyan rim light. Composition cinematic, neo-noir surrealism inspired by Ridley Scott and Wong Kar-wai, bold color contrast, reflective puddles framing his face, subtle motion blur on falling rain, intimate, uncanny, quietly futuristic, photorealistic analog 35mm portrait, subtle high dynamic range.
