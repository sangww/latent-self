Korean man in his mid-30s, vintage mustard corduroy suit and slim tie, stands in a vertical social-media story shot on the rooftop of a retro-futuristic 1970s monorail station tangled with oversized mechanical sunflowers. He leans in profile against a dented chrome vending machine that dispenses paper maps and analog cassette tapes, holding a faded Polaroid and a lit cigarette between fingers, gaze off-frame. Surreal yet ordinary, soft tungsten backlight, shallow depth of field, film grain, warm color palette, symmetrical composition a la Wes Anderson, Spielbergian glow and a Black Mirror undertone—photorealistic 35mm analog portrait, medium close-up. vertical story crop.
