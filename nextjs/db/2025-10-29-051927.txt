Korean man stands in a post-industrial warehouse, medium closeup holding a tarnished mechanical hummingbird cradled in both hands. He is age 45, wearing a worn leather mechanicâ€™s jacket over a white dress shirt, slightly unbuttoned. Composition: shallow depth of field, off-center, looking past the frame with a quiet, haunted expression. Lighting neo-noir: high-contrast rim light and warm tungsten spill, single cyan neon reflection on metal. Photorealistic analog film aesthetic, grainy 35mm texture, muted desaturated palette with one saturated neon highlight, inspired by Tarkovsky mood and Ridley Scott production design. Atmospheric dust motes, subtle lens flare, reflective puddles on concrete floor.
