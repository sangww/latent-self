Korean man, age 45 in a faded boiler jacket, medium-close portrait in post-industrial serenity: towering repurposed factory chimneys sprout glass greenhouses linked by suspended wooden bridges, rust and ivy, thin mist. He cradles a steaming tin cup, gaze off-camera, face lit by late golden hour, hands stained with oil and soil. Analog film photorealism, Tarkovsky-inspired cinematic surrealism: muted colors, warm grain, long depth, soft highlights and precise shadow detail. Composition balances human vulnerability and reclaimed industry, shallow depth focusing on textured skin and worn fabric, background industrial gardens rendered with delicate, melancholy clarity. subtle lens flare and timeless, quiet dignity.
