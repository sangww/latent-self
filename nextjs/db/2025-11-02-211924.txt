Korean man, early 30s, medium-close portrait in a retro-alt 1970s rooftop greenhouse amid a neon-streaked vertical city; he wears a mustard suede jacket and knit turtleneck, analog wrist-watch with spooled film strap, leaning against a rusted vending robot, holding a cracked flip phone that releases drifting Polaroid prints like confetti. Cinematic golden-hour backlight, soft grain, high-contrast analog photography, slight tilt, Wes Anderson symmetry meets Black Mirror unease. Surreal detail: a miniature tram of glowing incandescent bulbs runs along the lapel of his jacket. Social-media story framing, candid, intimate, subtle uncanny mood, photorealistic. saturated film colors, shallow depth, subtle film grain.
