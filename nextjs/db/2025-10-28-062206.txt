Korean man in his mid forties stands on a dusk rooftop, medium shot, adjusting a battered rangefinder. One forearm is replaced by a seamless brass and organic prosthesis where bioluminescent moss veins pulse soft teal and amber beneath glass. He wears a weathered wool overcoat over a linen shirt, sleeves rolled and leather fingerless gloves, hair salt and pepper, eyes steady. Behind him the city hums with neon bokeh; a Polaroid peeks from his pocket. Shot on analog 50mm lens f/1.8, ISO 400 film grain, warm Kodak Portra tones, slight chromatic aberration, gentle vignette and golden rim light, textured grain.
