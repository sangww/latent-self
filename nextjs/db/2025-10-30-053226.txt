Korean man, age 42, in a worn olive boiler suit with rolled sleeves and a soot-streaked leather apron, stands amid post-industrial serenity: an abandoned factory courtyard repurposed into a mossed repair garden. He cradles a humming mechanical bonsai — an engine block sprouting bioluminescent leaves — inspecting copper roots with oil-stained fingers. Medium close-up, three-quarter profile, soft analog film grain, muted sepia and teal palette, shallow depth of field. Surrealist yet grounded, evocative of Tarkovsky's melancholic compositions and Ridley Scott's textured production design; natural light from a broken skylight, cinematic, quietly otherworldly, intimate portrait, with faint distant factory sirens audible.
