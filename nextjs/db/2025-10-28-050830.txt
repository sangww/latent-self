Korean man, mid-40s, salt-and-pepper hair, weathered skin, wearing a faded bomber jacket and linen shirt, upper-body close-up, three-quarter profile looking past camera. Alternate-present Tokyo-like canal district where morning markets trade mechanical plants; a small bonsai-like clockwork bird perches on his shoulderâ€”absurd, delicate. Soft amber windowlight, film grain, shallow depth of field, 50mm lens equivalent, analog film color palette, slight vignetting. He holds a paper cup with steam curling into tiny holographic maps. Candid, unsmiling, contemplative. Background blurred stalls and neon reflections. Photorealistic, textured detail, natural skin tones, muted contrast, Instagram-ready retro aesthetic, soft bokeh highlights, subtle analog scratches, warm highlights.
