Korean man, mid-30s, medium close-up in a retro rooftop orchard at dusk, wearing a mustard corduroy blazer and vinyl windbreaker, holding a cracked transistor radio that spills tiny, precise brass micro-buildings from its speaker like clockwork, his face lit by warm streetlamp glow and soft film grain. He looks off-frame, hair damp from light drizzle, expression equal parts bemused and weary. Composition blends Wes Anderson symmetry, Spielberg warmth and Black Mirror unease; social-media candid aesthetic with analog 35mm color, shallow depth of field, slightly overexposed highlights, muted pastels, reflective sunglasses catching an impossible neon skyline, cinematic, photorealistic, soft tungsten bokeh.
