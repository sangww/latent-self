Korean man, 34, medium closeup, leaning under a neon canopy as dusk drizzle beads on an exoskeletal trench coat with reflective piping; he holds a palm-sized quantum compass, a tactile AR band pulsing soft cyan, while a retro-futuristic tram glides past on a suspended charging lattice behind him, wet street reflections and steam wafting, expression introspective, not looking at viewer, candid social feed vibe, cinematic still with heavy film grain, shallow depth of field, warm tungsten highlights and teal shadows, composition inspired by Wes Anderson symmetry and Spielberg emotion, photorealistic, 35mm analog, muted pastel palette, subtle highlight flare, softly lit.
