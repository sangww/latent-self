Korean man in a retro 1970s household kitchen, surrealist scene: a wall of stacked analog televisions showing mismatched silent family dinners, avocado-green cabinets, patterned linoleum. Mid-40s, wearing a mustard corduroy suit and thin tie, medium close-up adjusting an oversized rotary telephone with one hand while holding a faded Polaroid in the other, gaze off-camera. Warm tungsten light, high grain analog film texture, saturated mustard and teal palette, precise symmetrical composition with offbeat props. Photorealistic analog photograph aesthetic, cinematic framing inspired by Wes Anderson, strange familiarity, slightly absurd stillness, tactile details, shallow depth of field and soft film scratches for atmosphere.
