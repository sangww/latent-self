Korean man in his late 40s wearing a weathered charcoal trench coat and threadbare denim shirt stands in a post-industrial serenity setting: abandoned factory atrium converted into a quiet garden of suspended, bioluminescent moss globes. Medium close-up, three-quarter profile, hand resting on a rusted railing, soft steam drifting from vents behind him. Photorealistic analog film grain, muted silver-blue palette with electric teal highlights on the moss, shallow depth of field, cinematic lighting inspired by Tarkovsky and Ridley Scott, surrealism meets quiet human melancholy, composition bold yet intimate, tactile textures, evocative quietness, faint reflections of neon signage in puddles, static hum.
