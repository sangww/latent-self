Korean man in a robot modern home: a 42-year-old tailor in a faded tweed jacket sits at a wooden sewing table beneath a small domestic gravity generator that causes spools, scissors and fabric swatches to hover in a slow ballet. He steadies a floating needle with a magnetic thimble on his finger, eyes focused off-frame. Medium close-up, warm film grain, saturated pastels, cinematic symmetry Ã  la Wes Anderson with Black Mirror's clinical sheen. Photorealistic analog photography, soft window light, subtle lens flare, shallow depth of field, bold composition balancing uncanny domesticity and a hint of melancholy lingering.
