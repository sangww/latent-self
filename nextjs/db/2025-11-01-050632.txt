Korean man, 45-year-old vintage TV repairman in oil-stained coveralls, retro 1970s household kitchen. Surreal televisions stacked on a Formica counter show miniature, live dioramas of the same room an hour earlier; one screen frames his hands tinkering a circuit. Medium close-up, slightly off-center, cinematic analog film grain, warm pastel saturation and precise symmetry, shallow depth of field, tungsten kitchen light and subtle lens flare. Composition balances everyday domestic clutter—expired milk carton, rotary phone—with uncanny temporal tableaux inside CRTs. Surrealism style. Photorealistic, tactile textures, quirky ordinary-absurd tone, evocative of a Wes Anderson color scheme crossed with eerie Black Mirror domestic suspense.
