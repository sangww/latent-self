Korean man, 35, wearing a vintage pilot jacket and silver reflective scarf, medium close-up, leaning against a retro-futuristic tram stop in a rain-slick neon desert, dusk light, cinematic shallow depth, social-media candid vibe. He holds a palm-sized pocket AI projector—an opaque crystalline compass with spinning copper rings—casting intricate amber glyphs onto his palm. Wind tousles hair, eyes distant, three-quarter profile, natural film grain, Kodak Portra tones, Spielbergian warmth mixed with Black Mirror tension, composition by Wes Anderson symmetry, lens flare, subtle motion blur, photorealistic analog photograph, high resolution, moody and strangely ordinary. urban folklore undertones, quiet rebellion in his expression.
