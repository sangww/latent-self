Korean man, 46, vintage appliance restorer in a grease-stained denim apron, medium shot in a retro-alternative 1970s laundromat-atelier; he adjusts a battered brass domestic robot kettle on a tiled counter, sunlight slatted through venetian blinds, a cassette player, rotary phone and stacks of Polaroid film nearby. The room mixes post-modern minimalism with analog tech and a window framing coastal wind turbines. Inspired by Wes Anderson symmetry, Spielberg warmth and Black Mirror uncanny domesticity. Photorealistic 35mm film look, Kodak Portra tones, soft grain, shallow depth of field, cinematic framing, subtle color pop, natural light, slightly off-center composition. Hands inked, quietly focused.
