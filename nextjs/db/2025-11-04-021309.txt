Korean man in his early thirties, medium closeup, standing beneath neon-soaked overpass at golden hour, wearing a tailored charcoal coat and adaptive fiber scarf. He holds a transparent datapad projecting layered transit routes and moss-grown solar tiles behind him—an elevated mag-rail gliding silently past. Soft rain wets his hair, reflections in analog film grain. Pose: half-smile, looking past frame, hand tucked into pocket, subtle grit and hope. Cinematic color palette inspired by Spielberg warmth and Black Mirror edges, symmetrical composition à la Wes Anderson, shallow depth, natural rim light, photorealistic 35mm analog photograph, high detail, emotional storytelling, urban nocturne texture.
