Korean man in a retro-futurism alley, clutching a luminescent mechanical koi fish suspended in glass, wearing a scuffed leather bomber jacket with reflective silver piping, medium close-up, head turned three-quarters away from camera, rain-slick neon reflections on skin, shallow depth of field, analog film grain and warm tungsten tones, dramatic low-key lighting inspired by Ridley Scott, composition framed like a cinematic portrait, subtle surrealism where koi emits soft holographic ripples, photorealistic, tactile textures, melancholy mood, cinematic bokeh, precise color grading reminiscent of vintage 35mm photography. Subtle lens flare, muted cyan and amber palette, slight motion blur suggesting urban breeze softly.
