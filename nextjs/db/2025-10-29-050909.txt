Korean man, cyborgs and androids setting, close medium-shot three-quarter profile, age 38, wearing a worn charcoal leather jacket with a patched mechanical shoulder plate, and a copper ocular implant threaded with soft blue veins of light and visible gears. Photorealistic analog film aesthetic with warm Kodachrome color palette, tactile grain, shallow depth of field, rim lighting, oily neon reflections. Composition inspired by Ridley Scott neo-noir cinema, tactile textures and long lens compression, intimate yet uncanny. Emphasis on human skin detail, micro-expressions, and the cold glow of circuitry, and subtle backstory hints, faint mechanical scar across temple, inked serial number visible.
