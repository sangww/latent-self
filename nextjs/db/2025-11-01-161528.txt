Korean man in a retro alternative 1970s living room, faded orange wallpaper, low shag carpet, rotary radio, levitating vinyl records drift around him like small moons. He wears a worn mustard corduroy suit with wide lapels and a silk ascot. Medium closeup, three-quarter profile, fingertips lightly adjusting a spinning record suspended at chest height, gaze focused off-camera. Photorealistic analog photography: warm film grain, saturated sepia-rose tones, high dynamic range, shallow depth of field, cinematic symmetry and stillness inspired by Wes Anderson, a subtle surreal contrast between domestic familiarity and uncanny physics, soft tungsten highlights and subtly prominent analog lens flares.
