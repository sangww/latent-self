Korean man stands amid post-industrial serenity: a concrete courtyard where bioluminescent ivy reclaims rusted machinery. Wearing a distressed leather duster and simple gray shirt, age 42, he is captured in a medium closeup three-quarter profile, eyes off-camera, gloved hand hovering to touch a softly pulsing vine. Analog film grain, Kodak Portra tones, shallow depth of field, high dynamic range from neon-green blooms against warm tungsten spill. Cinematic neo-noir realism inspired by Ridley Scott and Tarkovsky: long shadow lines, minimal motion, contemplative mood. Photorealistic, tactile surfaces, subtle rim lighting outlining weathered skin and fabric fibers. Muted color contrast, cinematic lens flare.
