Korean man, 42-year-old, medium close-up portrait in a rain-slicked neon alley, retro-futuristic tram light behind him, wearing a battered brown leather jacket with reflective polymer collar, sliding one hand across a palm-sized gyroscopic datapuck clipped to his belt. Twilight drizzle, moody golden-magenta mixed light, shallow depth of field, 35mm film grain, Kodachrome warmth. Social-media candid style, not looking at lens, slight half-smile, lens flare and soft bokeh. Cinematic symmetry and color palette inspired by Wes Anderson, emotional warmth like Spielberg, uncanny tech tension of Black Mirror. Photorealistic analog photograph, natural skin tones, high detail. soft rain droplets on collar edges.
