Korean man, mid-40s, medium close-up in a retro-alternative 1970s skyfarm transit hub — concrete terraces, terraced hydroponic towers replaced by stacked solar mirrors and pastel chromed vending capsules. He wears a faded mustard turtleneck, suede jacket, clear plastic wrist console, and a woven scarf. He leans on a sun-warmed railing, looking sideways, holding a metal thermos emitting faint steam. Analog film grain, shallow depth, saturated but muted colors, cinematic framing inspired by Wes Anderson and Black Mirror, surreal minimalism, bold symmetrical composition, subtle lens flare, natural window light, personal Instagram journal vibe, intimate, everyday uncanny, photorealistic, soft film border vignette.
