Korean man, mid-40s watchmaker in a post-modern minimalistic apartment, polaroid-lit concrete and pastel furniture. The speculative element: a tiny orbiting pocket-sun, a brass, palm-sized artificial sun suspended above his workbench casting sharp micro-shadows. He sits in three-quarter profile, medium close-up, hands steady as he adjusts a miniaturized gear that floats between fingers. Composition echoes Wes Anderson symmetry: saturated pastels, precise framing, shallow depth of field, film grain, Kodak Portra tones, warm cross-processed highlights, 35mm analog texture, cinematic lens flare, a quietly strange domestic ritual, subtle rim light outlines his profile and aged hands with melancholy and a faint clockwork hum.
