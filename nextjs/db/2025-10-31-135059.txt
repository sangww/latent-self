Korean man in a robotic urbanity rooftop garden, mechanical koi drones arc between steel planters; worn navy technician jumpsuit; adjusting a backpack-sized servo pack, medium close-up, three-quarters profile, hands oily and precise. Background: rain-slick neon alley descending into stacked walkways, reflective glass and riveted metal, stray pigeons replaced by small servo-birds perched on a railing. Film grain, shallow depth of field, muted cyan and sepia highlights, cinematic neo-noir realism inspired by Ridley Scott, analog 35mm feel, high contrast, push-processed tones, intimate natural light from a single sodium streetlamp, austere yet lived-in, faint smell of oil and ozone suggest recent repairs.
