Korean man in a retro alternative 70s street: a rain-slick alley lined with towering neon hourglasses that drip liquid light, vinyl posters peeling. He is wearing a faded mustard corduroy suit, medium-close three-quarter shot, not looking at camera. Cinematic, Wes Andersonâ€“inspired retro surrealism: symmetrical framing, warm cross-processed analog film tones, saturated teal and orange, grainy Kodak texture. Background shows pedestrians in period clothing and a slow-moving monorail of chrome and wood. Photorealistic, bold color contrast, shallow depth of field, natural window light on face, tactile fabric detail, quiet melancholic absurdity. A faint scratch across the frame, soft cigarette smoke curling.
