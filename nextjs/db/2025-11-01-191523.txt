Korean man in his mid-40s, grease-stained coveralls, sits in a robot-modern apartment, medium close-up, tuning a brass domestic automaton's exposed mechanical heart while morning light slants through Venetian blinds. The world contains a single visible rule: household robots age like people, with patched plates and repaired springs. Symmetrical composition, slight off-center gaze, cinematic Wes Anderson minimalism blended with surreal stillness. Photorealistic analog photography, Kodak Portra tones, soft film grain, shallow depth of field, warm highlights, cool shadows, precise color palette of mustard, teal, and burnished chrome, bold yet intimate, quiet narrative tension, evoking vintage domestic sci-fi longing, subtle human-machine bond.
