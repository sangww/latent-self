Korean man stands in a retro-futuristic laundromat at dusk, medium closeup, 35–45 years old, wearing a faded mustard turtleneck and patched leather jacket. He holds a worn Polaroid camera that emits soft paper sparks, glancing sideways toward a conveyor of vintage cassette tapes and small domestic robots folded like origami. Cinematic, symmetrical framing inspired by Wes Anderson meets Black Mirror, Spielberg warmth in color grading. Surreal everyday detail: steam curling into miniature neon cityscapes above machines. Photorealistic analog film look, grainy 35mm texture, shallow depth of field, moody amber backlight, intimate Instagram story vibe, candid, slightly off-center, quiet futuristic melancholy.
