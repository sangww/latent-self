Korean man in a robot modern home, late 30s wearing a faded mechanic's jumpsuit, medium shot three-quarter profile tinkering with a pocket-sized domestic robotâ€”cracked porcelain shell exposing leaking vintage clockwork and tiny brass gears. Surrealist minimalism, cinematic symmetry inspired by Wes Anderson, photorealistic analog photography with warm film grain, shallow depth of field, deliberate color palette of mustard, teal, and burnt sienna. The scene balances everyday domesticity and subtle absurdity: a cluttered workbench, framed schematic prints, soft morning light through blinds, meticulous hands focused on adjusting a spinning escapement, off-camera gaze, contemplative quiet. subtle reflections in chrome and scratched lacquer.
