Korean man, in a robotic urbanity setting, a 45-year-old street mechanic wearing oil-stained coveralls and a cracked leather jacket, crouches over a half-disassembled delivery automaton beneath rain-slick neon canopies. Medium close-up, three-quarter profile, hands smudged with grease, face lit by warm tungsten and cold cyan neon, steam rising from vent seams. Composition uses shallow depth of field, film grain, Kodak Portra palette, high dynamic range analog realism. Neo-noir cinematic mood inspired by Ridley Scott: symmetrical framing, reflective puddles, tactile textures, slightly surreal tension. Photorealistic, intimate, everyday futurismâ€”strange but plausible; subtle asymmetry in props, muted neon reflections, exhausted city background lingering.
