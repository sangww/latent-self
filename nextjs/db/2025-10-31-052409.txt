Korean man in a retro 1970s household setting, age 48, wearing a mustard turtleneck and brown corduroy blazer with wide lapels, adjusting a rotary dial on a levitating vinyl record player surrounded by floating holographic family photos and translucent houseplants, medium close-up, three-quarter profile, soft tungsten light and warm film grain, composition with precise symmetry and off-kilter props, photorealistic analog photography, surrealism meets Wes Anderson framing and Tarkovsky depth of field, saturated autumnal palette, subtle dust, high dynamic range, shallow depth, evocative quiet tension, intimate domestic futurism, muted reflections in a cracked window, cigarette smoke curling, faint fluorescent hum present.
