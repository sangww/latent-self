Korean man, post-apocalyptic rooftop market, clutching a cracked glass terrarium that holds a wilting neon bonsai tree pulsing faint blue-pink light. He wears a patched leather duster, faded military scarf and fingerless gloves, age 35–45. Medium close-up, three-quarter profile, eyes looking past frame, shallow depth of field revealing rusted shipping containers and a distant smog-sun. Tarkovsky-inspired cinematic surrealism, analog film grain, muted earth tones with neon accent, soft backlight, long focal length compression. Photorealistic, tactile textures, subtle lens flare, melancholic mood — intimate, uncanny portrait blending ruin and fragile domesticity; dust motes drifting, holographic insects reflected in terrarium glass softly.
