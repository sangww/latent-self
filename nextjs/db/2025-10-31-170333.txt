Korean man, medium close up in a robotic urbanity setting, wears a worn oil leather courier jacket, adjusting brass goggles with steady hand. Around him, mechanical pigeons with brass wings and etched gears alight on chrome ledges; sunlight filtered through suspended monorail tracks casts cinematic shadows. Three quarter profile, eyes off camera, shallow depth of field isolates textured skin and weathered fabric.
