Korean man, late 30s, wearing a faded bomber jacket and matte silver prosthetic left hand, stands in a rain-slick neon alley at dusk, half-turned from the lens in a medium close-up. He cradles a vintage Polaroid-like print hovering on an electromagnetic rail—tiny copper coils glowing—while steaming urban moss clings to concrete. Composition channels Wes Anderson symmetry and Spielberg warmth with Black Mirror edge: shallow depth, film grain, warm tungsten highlights, cool teal shadows. His expression is quiet, resigned curiosity. Motion blur from distant mag-lev tram streaks, puddles reflecting LED billboards, tactile analog realism, cinematic color grading, high-resolution film stock aesthetic.
