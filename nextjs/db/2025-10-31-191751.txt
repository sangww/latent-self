Korean man maintenance technician, 35, in a worn gray jumpsuit, stands in a robotic urbanity train hub where towering vending-machine micro-apartments stack like neon-laced blocks. Medium shot: he tightens a copper bolt on a tiny balcony sprinkler, soot on his hands, gaze off-camera to the rain-slick tracks below. Analog photography aesthetic with warm Kodachrome tones, gentle film grain, shallow depth of field, cinematic rim lighting and reflective puddles. Composition balances human scale against claustrophobic vertical machines; details: scratched metal, dangling wires, faint fluorescent advertising panels. Neo-noir cinematic realism inspired by Ridley Scott; evocative, tactile, slightly dystopian. soft electric rain sounds.
