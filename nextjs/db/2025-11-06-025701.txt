Korean man, 34, medium-close portrait in a rainy neon undercity at dusk, wearing a scuffed leather bomber and wool scarf, leaning against a tile pillar, looking sideways. A swarm of palm-sized personal drones hovers behind him like a kinetic halo, their chrome shells reflecting pink and teal signage; a translucent ocular implant glows faintly at his temple. Film-grain, 35mm analog color, shallow depth, warm Spielberg light with Wes Anderson symmetry and Black Mirror tension. Social-media square crop, candid-posed, slight smile, urban mist, wet pavement reflections, long shadows, cinematic bokeh, editorial street-photography mood, soft lens flare and muted film-like color grading.
