Korean man stands in a rain-soaked 1970s highway rest stop at twilight, a retro-futuristic vending kiosk glowing beside him. He is 45, wearing a mustard trench coat and vintage aviators, half-turned in a medium close-up, holding a cracked mechanical wristwatch that projects thin paper-like maps. Neon reflections smear on wet asphalt, mist drifting; distant highway lights streak like film. Photorealistic analog photography, grainy Kodachrome tones, high dynamic range, shallow depth of field. Composition inspired by Wong Kar-wai and Wes Anderson: meticulous symmetry with melancholic warmth. Surreal everyday: small orbiting streetlights tethered by telephone wire. natural skin tones, candid snapshot aesthetic.
