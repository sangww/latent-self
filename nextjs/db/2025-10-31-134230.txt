Korean man, mid-40s metro maintenance technician in a worn insulated jacket and grease-darkened gloves, stands under robotic urbanity: rain-slick elevated tracks threaded with skeletal maintenance drones and glass-stitched monorails. He cradles a weathered mechanical wrist module being rewired, concentration in half-profile. Medium close-up, cinematic shallow depth-of-field, film grain, high-contrast cyan and amber palette, reflective puddles and neon edge light, slight lens flare. Photorealistic analog photograph inspired by Ridley Scott and film noir, composed with bold symmetry and tactile textures, everyday futurism balancing grit and strange beauty. Muted reflections capture city stories; a quiet dignity in worn hands, rain-smudged skin, resilient.
