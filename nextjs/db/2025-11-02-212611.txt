Korean man stands on a cracked, abandoned elevated subway car converted into a rooftop orchard of mechanical clock-trees, age about 42, wearing a faded 1970s windbreaker and wrinkled white shirt, medium close-up, three-quarter profile, looking past frame while cradling a vintage Polaroid camera. Surroundings: discarded CRT monitors sprout vines and printed circuit boards like signage, a slow-dripping neon sign reflects in rain-slick metal. Photorealistic analog film aesthetic: Kodak Portra tones, soft film grain, shallow depth, golden hour backlight. Surreal, cinematic slice-of-life in a retro-futurist Black Mirror meets Wes Anderson composition, intimate social-media story capture. ambient dust motes, warm bokeh everywhere.
