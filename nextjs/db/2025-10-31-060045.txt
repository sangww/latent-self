Korean man mid-40s wearing a mustard turtleneck and pleated trousers, in a retro 1970s household. A hovering glass terrarium bonsai emits soft amber bioluminescence beside a floating analog turntable with levitating vinyl records. Medium close-up, three-quarter profile, adjusting the spinning record with a deliberate, gentle hand, not looking at the camera. Photorealistic analog film aesthetic: warm grain, saturated mustard and avocado greens, diagonal sunlight rays, soft cinematic backlight, shallow depth of field. Composition adopts Wes Anderson-inspired retro minimalism â€” precise symmetry, bold color blocking, uncanny domestic calm, tactile vintage textures and subtle surrealism, faint dust motes suspended in warm sunlight.
