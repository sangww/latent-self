Korean man, post-industrial serenity rooftop: a 45-year-old examines a moss-wreathed clockwork turbine repurposed as a ceramic-flower aerator. Medium close-up, profile, hands steady as he adjusts a brass calibration dial; soft tungsten backlight glows through dust, muted teal-and-umber palette, shallow depth of field, tactile film grain. Composition balances human focus with towering derelict machinery softened by cultivated greenery. Surrealism with Tarkovsky-like stillness and Ridley Scott's textured realism, analog 35mm aesthetic, gentle vignetting, precise shadows, evocative silence, photorealistic, intimate, slightly uncanny. Subtle lens flare, warm grain, slightly faded highlights, careful framing evokes a weathered mechanical cathedral bathed in late industrial amber light.
