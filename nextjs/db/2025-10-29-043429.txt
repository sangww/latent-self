Korean man in an alternative biosphere stands in a dim greenhouse, a single glowing bioluminescent bonsai suspended in a glass terrarium cradled in his hands. He wears a patched field scientist jumpsuit with faint luminescent stitching, medium close up three quarter profile, eyes on the tree, soft backlight rim and green ambient bloom. Photorealistic analog photograph, Kodak Portra film grain, shallow depth of field, warm shadows and cool highlights, dynamic range. Surrealism informed by Tarkovsky's meditative framing and Ridley Scott's textured production design, bold color contrast, mystery, contemplative mood, precise composition, detail, soft film flare, subtle dust and visible scratches.
