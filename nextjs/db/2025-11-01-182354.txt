Korean man, age 42, sits in a sunlit robot modern home kitchen, mid-shot attending to a porcelain domestic automaton with delicate mechanical hands. A single linen glove on his left hand, he adjusts a tiny rivet while the automaton holds a chipped porcelain teacup. Surrealist composition inspired by Wes Anderson: centered geometry, muted mustard and teal palette, offbeat symmetry. Photorealistic analog photography lookâ€”Kodak Portra 400, 35mm, warm grain, shallow depth, soft film flare. Close, intimate expression, not facing camera; domestic futurism feels oddly mundane and slightly uncanny, balancing tidy realism with whimsical absurdity. subtle chrome reflections punctuate morning ritual ceremony.
