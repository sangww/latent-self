Korean man, age 42, in a worn leather flight jacket and faded denim, stands medium-shot in a post-industrial landscape inside a rusted factory atrium. He adjusts a glass-encased mechanical bonsai—tiny brass gears and bioluminescent leaves—hands steady, eyes intent. Behind him, corrugated walls catch amber backlight. Photorealistic analog film grain, shallow depth of field, muted teal and ochre palette, Tarkovsky-inspired long-focus composition with Ridley Scott industrial sheen, surrealist undertones. Cinematic Rembrandt lighting, delicate lens flare, slightly desaturated contrast, intimate but uncanny mood, medium close-up, emphasis on texture and quiet storytelling. foreground dust motes glitter like tiny satellites, and lingering metallic scent.
