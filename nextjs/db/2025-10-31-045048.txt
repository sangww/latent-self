Korean man in a post-industrial serenity setting, surrounded by moss-slick rust towers transformed into floating koi gardens; bioluminescent water spills from reclaimed piping. He is age 38, wearing a worn olive mechanic's jacket with brass buttons and oil-smudged linen shirt. Medium closeup, three-quarter profile, hands cradling a trembling glass jar of phosphorescent water, gaze toward distant smog-lit skyline. Photorealistic analog film, Tarkovsky-inspired cinematic surrealism: long-lens compression, soft halation, rich grain, muted teal and rust color grading, meticulous symmetrical framing, dramatic backlit rim light and shallow depth of field, tactile texture, quietly uncanny mood, wet concrete reflections and distant ship horns.
