Korean man, age 42, union repairman in an oil-stained jacket with welding goggles around his neck, stands in a post-industrial serenity landscape where towering rusted machines have been repurposed into libraries whose metal pages shimmer. Medium shot, three-quarter profile as he leans on a concrete balustrade, cradling a steaming tin mug, eyes distant. Cinematic Tarkovsky-inspired surrealism, muted teal and ochre palette, high-contrast film grain, shallow depth of field, analog 35mm aesthetic. Bold composition, soft backlight rim, subtle reflections on rain-slick metal, photorealistic texture detail, atmosphere heavy with dust and quiet resilience and the distant echo of an old factory siren.
