Korean man in a robotic urbanity skyline, steam-sheen chrome towers and suspended conveyor gardens; an iridescent train threads between them. Outfit: worn leather flight jacket with retrofit cybernetic forearm. Medium close-up, three-quarter profile, he lights a cigarette whose ember reflects neon signage, gaze drawn to a distant monorail. Photorealistic analog 35mm photograph, Neo-noir cinematic realism inspired by Ridley Scott: high contrast film grain, cool blue-green highlights, warm practical tungsten spill on his face, shallow depth of field, careful composition, everyday futurism tension â€” intimate, slightly uncanny, balanced between grit and polished design, and muted city scent lingering like memory, quietly humming.
