Korean man in his mid-30s, medium close-up, wearing a vintage bomber jacket and wool turtleneck, leaning against a rain-slick neon alley at dusk. He looks off-frame, hair damp, a faint scar along his jaw. Beside him, a battered street kiosk pulses: a retro-futuristic memory recorder with spooled magnetic cartridges and brass dials, softly whirring. Wet light reflects off chrome and puddles. Photorealistic analog film grain, shallow depth of field, 35mm Kodachrome palette, symmetric composition with off-center subject, cinematic tone blending Wes Anderson colorism, Spielberg warmth and Black Mirror unease. Social-media candid vibe, intimate, provocative, uncanny ordinary, quiet mechanical heartbeat visible.
