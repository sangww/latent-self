Korean man, 45 year old tailor in a faded plaid waistcoat, sits in a retro 1970s household kitchen repurposed as a sewing nook; medium close up profile, threading a needle by amber lamplight, not facing the camera. Behind him wallpaper of rotating brass gears rearranges into constellation like patterns, a subtle fantastical world element. Composition balances Wes Anderson symmetry with Tarkovsky stillness, surrealist cinematic tone. Photorealistic analog photography: 35mm film grain, warm cross processed palette, saturated teals and ochres, deep soft shadows, texture on fabric and skin, familiar color grading, quietly uncanny intimacy with film edge vignetting and dust motes.
