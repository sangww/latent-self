Korean man in a retro-futuristic science fiction greenhouse, a suspended anti-gravity koi orb (a transparent sphere with tiny floating bioluminescent fish) hovers beside him. He is 42, wearing a worn silver flight jacket and faded denim, medium close-up as he reaches out, fingertips grazing the orb. Warm film grain, Kodachrome analog photography, rim-lit neon greens and amber, shallow depth of field, lens flare, tactile moisture on glass. Cinematic surrealism inspired by Ridley Scott: meticulous production design, moody atmosphere, high-contrast color grading, intimate composition, capturing quiet wonder and human scale within advanced, slightly decayed tech. soft bokeh background evokes distant city.
