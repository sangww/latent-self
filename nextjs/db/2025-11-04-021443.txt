Korean man, mid-30s, medium-close portrait, wearing a faded bomber jacket with reflective circuitry, standing under rain-washed neon at dusk beside a silent mag-lev tram with polished chrome ribs; he holds a palm-sized quantum key device, a translucent slab humming cerulean light, and stares past the frame, expression unreadable. Street wet, steam rising, distant metropolitan skyline of stacked arcologies. Cinematic analog film grain, 35mm medium-format look, warm teal-and-amber color grading, soft film halation, shallow depth-of-field. Composition inspired by Spielberg noir and Black Mirror surrealism, candid social-media snapshot vibe, evocative, intimate, slightly uncanny. old neon stickers peeling from nearby lampposts, glass reflections.
