Korean man in his early thirties, medium-close portrait leaning against a weathered roadside jukebox in a retro-futuristic coastal fallout shelter, mustard corduroy jacket with reflective piping, vintage aviator sunglasses lifted, hand on a mechanical wristwatch with glowing analog rings; golden hour drizzle softens neon signs and salt-streaked windshields, subtle steam from vents. Cinematic composition inspired by Wes Anderson symmetry and Spielberg warmth, Black Mirror uncanny detail. Photorealistic 35mm film look, Kodak Portra tones, shallow depth of field, soft grain, light leaks, candid social-media vibe, sideways gaze, natural expression, storytelling intimacy, medium shot. subtle urban relics frame him like private monuments.
