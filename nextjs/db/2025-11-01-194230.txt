Korean man in a robot modern home setting, a 40-year-old appliance repair technician wearing a worn denim jacket and grease-stained white shirt, medium close-up three-quarter profile, adjusting an antique-looking sentient refrigerator's brass analog dial. The kitchen is tidy minimal, chrome robots idle in background, window shows hovering tram lines. Soft tungsten film grain, warm cross-processed color palette, symmetrical framing, whimsical tension like Wes Anderson meets Black Mirror, shallow depth of field, cinematic lens flare, tactile details: fingerprints, worn leather tool bag, steam curling from a cup. Photorealistic analog photograph, bold composition and uncanny everydayness, quietly humming with domestic intelligence nearby.
