Korean man, 48, night-shift elevator mechanic in a retro-alt 1970s vertical garden apartment, medium-close shot, slightly turned away from camera tinkering with a brass control panel. Cinematic, Wes Anderson symmetry meets Black Mirror uncanny calm: muted avocado-and-burnt-orange palette, soft tungsten street lamps outside a rain-streaked porthole window. Props: dented toolbox, analog multimeter, aged cassette player spitting quiet static, potted succulents on metal shelves, neon-faded directory sign. Photorealistic analog film aesthetic, Kodak Portra tones, shallow depth of field, subtle film grain, 50mm lens, natural tungsten rim light, intimate everyday futurism, contemplative, strangely ordinary, quiet narrative, warm shadows framing small hopeful gestures.
