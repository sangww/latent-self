Korean man in an ubertechnological urban landscape, medium close three-quarter profile shot, age 35-45, wearing a tailored matte-black trench coat with reflective piping. He reaches toward a hovering mechanical origami crane pulsing soft cyan and magenta light above a rain-slick street. Background: layered holographic billboards, wet asphalt reflections, distant monorail streaks. Film grain, 35mm analog color negative, shallow depth of field, high contrast, saturated neon palette. Cinematic neon-noir mood inspired by Ridley Scott and Wong Kar-wai, intimate, slightly surreal, tactile textures, careful rim lighting, photorealistic, bold composition capturing quiet futurism, softly reflected in his eyes, suggesting memory and urban longing.
