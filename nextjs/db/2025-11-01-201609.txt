Korean man, mid-40s repair technician in a worn gray jumpsuit, medium close-up in a robot modern home: he adjusts a slow-turning brass gyroscope 'sun' suspended in the living room, hands dusted with oil, side profile, not facing camera. Ambient warm incandescent light filters through louvered blinds, deep Kodak Portra film grain, 50mm lens, shallow depth of field. Surrealist cinematic composition with Wes Anderson symmetry and Spielberg warmth: saturated but muted palette, meticulous domestic details, peeling wallpaper, chrome appliances â€” uncanny calm, bold yet intimate, photoreal analog photograph, tactile textures, careful negative space, subtle vignette, muted reflections on polished surfaces, quiet narrative.
