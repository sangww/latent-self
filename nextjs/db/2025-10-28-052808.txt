Korean man, age fifty, stands knee-deep in a flooded subway platform where fluorescent signs float like paper lanterns, each sign exhaling faint bioluminescent mist. He wears a threadbare wool coat over a slim linen suit, vintage watch visible, hands steady as he tends a glass terrarium cradling a miniature city of brass and moss. The terrarium pulses with slow mechanical tides, tiny windmills turning. Ambient film grain, muted color palette, soft tungsten highlights, 35mm analog lens, shallow depth of field. The image feels intimate and uncanny, a quiet ritual caught between daily commute and botanical necropolis and forgotten subway gods.
