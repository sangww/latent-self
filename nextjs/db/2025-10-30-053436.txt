Korean man, age 48, in a worn charcoal overcoat and frayed tweed scarf, stands in a post-industrial serenity â€” a flooded warehouse where a suspended rusted subway car has been converted into a hanging greenhouse. He cradles a single translucent mechanical lotus that emits warm amber filament-light, medium shot, three-quarter profile, eyes off-camera. Photorealistic analog photography: Kodak Portra tones, soft film grain, long exposure glow, high contrast tungsten rim light. Surrealism meets Tarkovsky and Ridley Scott: haunting quiet, bold color accents, meticulous composition, shallow depth of field, evocative urban-ruin intimacy. subtle reflections in standing water trace neon circuitry like ghost maps.
