Korean man in a retro 1970s household kitchen, surrounded by floating glass terrariums containing tiny mechanical orchids emitting soft amber pulses. He is 48, wearing a mustard turtleneck, olive tweed blazer, and vintage round glasses, mid-shot leaning toward a sunlit Formica counter, adjusting a chrome rotary dial that controls the terrariums' heartbeat. Analog film aesthetic, warm vintage grain, soft cinematic symmetry Ã  la Wes Anderson with Tarkovskian depth, saturated ochres and teals, dramatic rim light, shallow depth of field, photorealistic, tactile textures of fabric and ceramics, slightly bold framing, quiet surreal domesticity, hint of melancholic nostalgia and gentle mystery lingering.
