Korean man in a robot modern home, surrounded by muted chrome surfaces and domestic automatons with mismatched vintage parts. A faulty ceiling moon-lamp drips viscous warm light like slow honey onto a lacquered table. Outfit: rumpled cardigan and suspenders. Medium shot, 3/4 profile, cradling the dripping moon-lamp in both hands, wiping luminous residue on his sleeve, eyes intent but distant. Photorealistic analog film photograph, surrealism fused with Wes Anderson's symmetrical color-blocking and Spielbergian lens flares, shallow depth of field, grainy 35mm texture, bold warm-cool contrast, quiet absurdity, everyday intimacy. He watches tiny mechanical sparks and tea steam curling like copper.
