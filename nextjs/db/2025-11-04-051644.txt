Korean man, mid-30s, wearing a weathered denim jacket with reflective fiber stitching and a brass collar, medium closeup candid pose, not looking at lens, leaning against rain-slick neon concrete on a rooftop at twilight under acid drizzle. He cradles a handheld memory spool — a brass, glass-reel device that stores and plays tactile memories as spinning crystal film — its soft cyan glow reflecting on his palms. Atmosphere: moody teal-orange cinema lighting, gritty noir rain, slight film grain, Kodak Portra tones, shallow depth of field, social-feed snapshot vibe, inspired by Black Mirror meets Spielberg, intimate, provocative, analog photographic realism, warm rim light.
