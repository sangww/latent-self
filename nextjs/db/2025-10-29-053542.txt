Korean man in a neo-modern hyper-minimalistic apartment, mid-40s, wearing a tailored silver utility jacket and high-waisted linen trousers. He sits in medium close-up, three-quarter profile, hand hovering over a levitating glass bonsai chamber, miniature chrome branches threaded with pulsing blue bioluminescent moss. Analog film grain, warm tungsten rim light and cool practicals create cinematic chiaroscuro, soft shallow depth of field. Composition inspired by Ridley Scott's futurism and Wong Kar-wai's intimate color poetry. Photorealistic, slight overexposure highlights, subdued pastel palette with neon accents, bold framing that balances human texture and speculative object, shot on expired film, tactile grain, evocative silence, stillness.
