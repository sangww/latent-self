Korean man in a retro-futurism diner setting, clutching a tarnished vacuum-sealed cassette drive, wearing a patched leather bomber with reflective piping, captured in a medium close-up three-quarter profile, hands lit by neon blue and amber, cigarette smoke curling around a metal booth, analog film grain and shallow depth of field, Kodak Portra color palette, surrealism aesthetic, cinematic framing inspired by Ridley Scott and Wes Anderson, tactile texture, moody tungsten highlights, deliberate asymmetry, soft bokeh, subtle lens flare, narrative stillness suggesting quiet rebellion and lonely futurist longing, worn emulsion edges, faint neon reflections on skin, reflective chrome details, soft rain drizzle.
