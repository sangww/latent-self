Korean man, 34, medium close-up in a retro-futuristic 1970s coastal highway diner at golden hour, wearing rust-orange corduroy suit and a slim mechanical wrist-console, adjusting translucent visor while looking slightly off-frame. Social-media candid vibe, soft analog film grain, Kodak cross-processed warmth, shallow depth of field, light leaks, dust motes. Surreal twist: a line of suspended neon tram rails stitched into the low clouds and a single vintage television perched like a streetlamp behind him, glinting. Directional cinematic composition inspired by Wes Anderson symmetry, Spielberg nostalgia, Black Mirror unease, photorealistic, natural film lighting, warm color grading, candid smile, subtle urban decay.
