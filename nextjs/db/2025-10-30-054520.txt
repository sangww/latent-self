Korean man, age 42, medium close-up in a post-industrial serenity setting: he wears a faded brown leather duster and charcoal wool turtleneck, clutching a steamed, brass-framed pocket compass that glows faintly. Behind him, a derelict factory courtyard hosts a solitary, rusted clockwork tree whose copper branches cradle glass terrariums of moss. Analog film grain, warm cross-processed tones, shallow depth of field, natural window light, slight film burn at edges. He looks off-camera, contemplative, Polaroid color palette with muted ochres. Surrealism, Tarkovsky-inspired melancholic composition, photorealistic analog photograph, cinematic, textured, intimate medium shot. soft rim lighting, subtle lens flare, quiet industrial silence.
