Korean man in a robot modern home, wearing a tailored linen jumpsuit, tends a chrome bonsai with delicate robotic shears. The living room's world element: a slow-rotating solar-slab ceiling casting warm circular shafts. Medium close-up, three-quarter profile, hands mid-prune, eyes focused off-frame. Composition balances symmetrical furniture and an absurd floating armchair tethered by velvet cord. Photorealistic analog film aesthetic: grainy Kodak warmth, slight vignetting, high-contrast color grading, bold pastel teal and mustard accents. Surrealist minimalism with Wes Anderson-inspired symmetry and precise mise-en-sc√®ne, quiet domestic oddity, intimate, uncanny, cinematic snapshot quality. Soft natural rim light, shallow depth of field, evocative stillness.
