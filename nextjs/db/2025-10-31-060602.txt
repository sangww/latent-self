Korean man, transit mechanic, medium close-up, three-quarter profile, in a rain-slick robotic urbanity: towering skybridges threaded with exposed servomotors and suspended pneumatic light-arteries. He adjusts a serpentine data-tube that coils across his forearm, oil-smudged hands catching muted neon glows and salty rain. Background shows distant drone traffic and glass fa√ßades scarred with maintenance stencils, bokeh of amber and cyan. Photorealistic analog 35mm photograph, neo-noir cinematic mood inspired by Ridley Scott: high contrast, fine film grain, shallow depth of field, tactile textures, naturalistic skin tones, slightly desaturated palette, bold off-center composition, emotive and everyday futurism. soft rim light scuffs his jawline.
