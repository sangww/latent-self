Korean man in a retro alternative 1970s neon alley, medium close-up three-quarter profile. He is a 47-year-old bicycle courier wearing a mustard corduroy jacket, patched denim, and industrial goggles. He holds a freshly ejected analog Polaroid that bleeds exaggerated color like wet paint. Behind him, miniature floating typewriter drones deliver stamped envelopes, tethered to lampposts; chrome and PVC reflect saturated signage. Composition echoes Wes Anderson-inspired surrealism: precise symmetry, warm Kodachrome tones, cinematic depth, creamy film grain, soft backlight rim, and a bold, slightly offbeat color palette. Photorealistic analog photograph, focus on texture and human grit. With subtle lens flare accents.
