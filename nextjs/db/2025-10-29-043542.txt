Korean man in a black-mirror dystopia, medium close-up holding a cracked handheld hologram projector shaped like a moth-eaten pocket watch, reflecting flickering city ads, wearing a faded charcoal leather tech-jacket with woven neon teal seams over a high-collar gray knit, half-turned from camera, gaze off-frame, rain-slick neon reflections on skin, shallow depth of field, film grain, analog Kodak warmth, cinematic lighting inspired by Ridley Scott and Tarkovsky, high contrast, subdued palette punctuated by neon, composition balanced with negative space, tactile wet textures, cinematic photorealism, intimate, uncanny, precise focus on face and the glowing device, softly distorted reflection in discarded visor.
