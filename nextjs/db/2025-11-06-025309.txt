Korean man, age 42, medium close-up, rainy dusk rooftop garden beside an abandoned monorail, wearing a faded leather bomber threaded with cyan fiber-optic seams, adjusting a palm-sized analog-quantum key — a folded e-ink map that blooms into layered paper-like layers of city data. He looks off-frame, contemplative, rain on his collar, neon reflections on wet concrete, small electroluminescent moss clinging to railings. Photorealistic analog film aesthetic: Portra tones, fine grain, shallow depth, soft tungsten rim light, symmetrical composition with subtle Black Mirror unease and Wes Anderson color precision, Spielberg-like warm backlight, cinematic mood. Shot on vintage 35mm film, nostalgic grain texture.
