Korean man, age 45, stands in a post-modern city at duskâ€”medium shot, three-quarter profile, reaching toward a streetlight that drips molten neon like colored glass. He wears a weathered tailored coat, collar up, cigarette smoldering between fingers. The skyline folds into stacked glass towers and distant trains, lights blurred into soft streaks. Analog film grain, warm Kodak Portra tones with high-contrast teal shadows; shallow depth of field, soft bokeh, cinematic surrealism inspired by Tarkovsky's melancholy and Wes Anderson's precise color blocking. Photorealistic, intimate, slightly uncanny, bold framing, tactile textures; subtle rain streaks on windowpane behind him, warm streetlamp halo glow.
