Korean man in a robot modern home setting: a mid-40s tailor wearing a grease-stained leather apron, fingers adjusting an articulated soft-robotic sleeve on a mannequin arm. The apartment is bright with matte pastel walls and modular chrome furniture with articulated foam tendrils, parcels on ceiling rails. Medium closeup profile, shallow depth of field, film grain, Kodachrome warmth, saturated mustard and teal palette, precise symmetrical composition, slight off-center rule of thirds, window light backlit rim, subtle lens flare. Surrealism inspired by Wes Anderson meets analog documentaryâ€”everyday domestic absurdity captured like a staged, intimate portrait on 35mm film. gentle bokeh and texture.
