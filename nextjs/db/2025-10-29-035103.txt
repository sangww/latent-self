Korean man in a surreal ecology: an overgrown urban greenhouse where oversized ferns drip luminescent spores. He wears scuffed canvas workwear and leather gloves, holding a wrist-sized mechanical dragonfly with brass wings and a glass abdomen. He examines the creature with fine brass tweezers, tiny gears catching light. Tight medium shot, three-quarter profile, camera at a low angle, shallow depth of field, film grain and Kodachrome-like saturation, vivid greens and warm copper highlights. Soft rim backlight, wet-earth reflections on glass, candid contemplative expression, photorealistic analog photography, bold composition balancing intimate portraiture and uncanny botanical detail, and faint ozone smell lingering.
