Korean man, post-industrial serenity setting with crumbling factory beams softened by hanging moss and steam, a single world element: a drifting archive of rusted wind-up automata tethered to pulley lines. He is a 45-year-old in a threadbare coat. Medium close-up, three-quarter profile, hands cradling a tarnished mechanical compass and gaze directed past frame. Photorealistic analog film still, Tarkovskian minimalism: muted color palette, long-grain film texture, shallow depth of field, soft natural sidelighting, subtle lens flare. Composition balances human detail and rusted machinery, quiet melancholy, cinematic scale, tactile surfaces and warm ambers against cool steel, evoking timeworn memory and fragile hope.
