Korean man in his late 40s, wearing a faded 1970s tram conductor uniform and a thin smartwatch, stands in a sunlit, retro-futuristic laundromat built inside a greenhouse-like skyscraper. He adjusts a stack of matte cassette-like data cartridges, hands stained with detergent, medium close-up, eyes off-camera. Background: warm Wes Anderson color palette, precise symmetry, Spielbergian soft rim light, subtle Black Mirror tension. Props: analog film camera on counter, slow-turning ceiling fans, chrome vending machine with tiny mechanical clocks. Photorealistic 35mm film grain, muted saturated colors, minimal surrealism, quiet everyday uncanny mood, shallow depth of field, warm nostalgia and precise alienation tonality.
