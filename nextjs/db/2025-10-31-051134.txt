Korean man in a retro 1960s household kitchen, 45-year-old wearing a mustard polyester leisure suit and narrow tie, sits at a Formica table illuminated by a pendant lamp. A small, levitating vinyl player spins above the table, projecting translucent family-moment holograms into the steam of a teacup. Medium closeup, three-quarter profile looking at the projection, hands mid-reach, composition precise and slightly symmetrical Ã  la Wes Anderson with warm Kodachrome tones, film grain, shallow depth of field, soft vignette, photorealistic analog photography, cinematic stillness and uncanny domestic nostalgia. Muted chrome appliances, period wallpaper pattern, faint lens flare from window light. foreground.
