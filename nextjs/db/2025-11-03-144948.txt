Korean man in his late thirties, wearing a retro-futuristic tweed jacket and a silver wrist device, seated at a rain-speckled tram stop under neon kanji signage. Medium close-up, three-quarter profile, slightly looking away as if listening to a distant announcement. Twilight drizzle, warm tungsten pooling on wet pavement. Background shows anachronistic tramcars and a clockwork sentinel perched on a lamppost with brass gears. Cinematic framing inspired by Wes Anderson symmetry and Black Mirror unease, Spielbergian soft lens flare. Photorealistic analog film grain, shallow depth of field, 35mm portrait, muted teal and amber color grading, candid social-media aesthetic. urban nocturnal hush.
