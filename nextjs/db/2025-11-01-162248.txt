Korean man, in a sunlit robot-modern kitchen-living room hybrid, medium shot, late 30s, wearing a patched navy jumpsuit and oil-stained canvas apron, seated on a chrome stool, hands repairing a small domestic service robot with exposed gears and warm brass plates. Around him, ceiling-suspended micro-orchard platforms rotate slowly—miniature citrus trees in metal planters on magnetic tracks—casting patterned shadows. His expression is focused, profile turned toward the work, soft film grain, shallow depth of field, rich saturated Kodachrome tones, symmetrical composition with Wes Anderson precision and Spielbergian warmth, photorealistic analog 35mm, bold color contrast, slightly absurd everyday intimacy. Warm morning light.
