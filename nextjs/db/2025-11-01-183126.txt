Korean man in a robot-modern home, mid-40s appliance repair technician wearing a faded denim jumpsuit, seated in a sunlit kitchen of brushed steel and warm wood. He cradles a small clockwork bonsai, brass branches and exposed gears, adjusting a levitating ceramic teacup suspended by visible magnetic rails. Medium-close portrait, three-quarter profile, not looking at camera; shallow depth of field, cinematic rim light. Photorealistic analogue film aesthetic: medium-format frame, subtle film grain, Kodak Portra colors. Surrealist minimalism with Wes Anderson symmetry influence, composition balanced and slightly uncanny, everyday objects rendered with meticulous tactile detail, soft reflective surfaces, muted yet saturated palette.
