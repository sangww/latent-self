Korean man in a worn mustard trench coat with subtle LED piping holds a steaming paper cup; above the cup hovers a miniature holographic cityscape, neon storefronts reflected in raindrops on his sleeve. Setting: ubertechnological everyday street, rain-slick pavement, vending kiosks glowing with soft cyan. Medium close-up, three-quarter profile, not looking at camera, shallow depth of field, rim-lit by neon. Composition balances intimate portrait and busy urban bokeh. Photorealistic analog film aesthetic, grainy, warm color grading, inspired by Wes Anderson framing and Ridley Scott atmosphere, surrealism, high detail, cinematic mood. soft lens flare and muted highlights evoke quiet futuristic melancholy.
