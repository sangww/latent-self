Korean man, mid-40s, stands three-quarter in a rain-slick technopunk canal alley, medium shot framed shoulder-up, wearing a faded charcoal work coat stitched with bioluminescent seamlines that pulse like heartbeat; under a translucent collar small fungal fronds curl, living adornments that exhale soft amber spores. A lens implant glints at his left eye, concentric rings faintly rotating. He doesn't look at camera, gaze angled toward distant neon reflections. Filmic 35mm portrait, Kodak Portra tones, shallow depth of field, gentle grain, warm tungsten rim light and subtle overexposure on highlights, evocative composition balancing human presence and strange urban ecology. soft rain whispering.
