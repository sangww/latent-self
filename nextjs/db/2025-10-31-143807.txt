Korean man, set in post-industrial serenity among collapsed factory catwalks repurposed as quiet botanical terraces, a single world element: a towering rusted smokestack converted into a translucent water garden visible in background. He is a 42-year-old salvage engineer, medium close-up adjusting a salvaged brass eyepiece, hands oily, gaze focused off-camera. Photorealistic analog 35mm film aesthetic, Tarkovsky-inspired surrealism: muted, melancholic palette with sudden warm highlights, deep cinematic grain, soft flares, shallow depth of field. Composition balances human subject against reclaimed machinery and gentle plant growth, intimate, slightly bold framing, tactile textures, natural film light, with faint steam and wet concrete smell.
