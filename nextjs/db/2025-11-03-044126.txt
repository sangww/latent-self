Korean man, mid-40s, wearing a faded 1970s flight jacket and knit turtleneck, medium close-up on a sun-drenched rooftop greenhouse of a retro-futuristic train station at golden hour. He holds a cracked vintage wristwatch that glows faintly with secret circuitry, staring past frame, quiet smile. Light leaks, shallow depth of field, film grain, muted teal and warm orange palette, social media candid aesthetic. Slight drizzle creates glints on metal rails, distant neon signage and sculptural wind turbines frame background. Photorealistic analog photography, composed like Wes Anderson meets Spielberg’s wonder, cinematic, intimate, subtly surreal, soft film flare, high dynamic range, nostalgic mood.
