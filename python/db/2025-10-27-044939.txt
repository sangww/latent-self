A 35-year-old Korean man with short, neatly styled black hair and a subtle beard stands in a bustling, retro-futuristic marketplace, where holographic vendors advertise wares. He's dressed in a vintage denim jacket over a white turtleneck, exuding an air of casual confidence. His expression is contemplative as he examines a small, glowing artifact in his left hand, the light casting interesting shadows on his face. The scene is bathed in warm, golden hour lighting, with soft bokeh from the vibrant stalls behind him. The composition focuses on his upper body in a close-up, slightly angled to the left, capturing the bustling atmosphere around him.
