Korean man in a neo-modern minimalistic high-rise kitchen, a transparent living wall of floating bioluminescent moss suspended in hexagonal glass modules glows behind him. He is 42, wearing a tailored graphite turtleneck and a charcoal apron with subtle holographic seams, medium close-up at three-quarter profile, hands mid-motion slicing an iridescent fruit that refracts neon dusk through the window. Film grain, Kodak Portra tones, shallow depth, cinematic soft backlight à la Wes Anderson symmetry with Tarkovsky stillness, saturated teal and burnt orange palette, tactile textures, evocative, quietly uncanny — photoreal analog portrait, subtle reflections and long shadows framing his contemplative expression.
