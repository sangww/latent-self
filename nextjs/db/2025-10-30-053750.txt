Korean man in a post-industrial serenity setting: a ruined factory courtyard overgrown with grass and wildflowers, shafts of diffuse sunlight through broken skylights. He cradles a moss-covered analog typewriter fused with bioluminescent brass gears, fingers poised above keys. Medium shot, 42-year-old in a worn denim jacket, salt-gray stubble, eyes averted toward the soft fog. Photorealistic analog photography, Tarkovsky-inspired atmosphere with soft film grain, muted palette warmed by subtle emerald and copper highlights, shallow depth of field, cinematic composition, quiet melancholy, textured surfaces, gentle rim lighting, slow contemplative mood, tactile and strangely ordinary yet uncanny, subtle filmic color bleed and memory.
