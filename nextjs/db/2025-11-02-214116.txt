Korean man, 34, medium shot in a lemon-scented retro-futuristic bus stop suspended over an overgrown monorail, wearing a 1970s shearling jacket patched with LED strips, holding a vintage transistor radio fused to a translucent smartphone, half-turned, eyes on a cracked visor reflecting neon signage. Social-media story composition, vertical crop, candid mood. Photorealistic analogue film aesthetic: warm tungsten light, shallow depth, grainy 35mm texture, soft bokeh. Surreal element: vending machines sprout clockwork flowers behind him, slow mechanical moths drift. Inspired by Wes Anderson symmetry, Spielberg warmth, Black Mirror unease. Close, intimate, slightly off-center framing, film light leaks and muted pastel tones.
