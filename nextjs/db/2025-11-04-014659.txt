Korean man, age 38, medium close-up, half-turned away from frame, wearing a worn olive trench and a brass-capped denim collar, standing on a rain-slick neon-lit overpass at dusk beside a scratched autonomous tram control terminal, fingertips resting on a tactile metal keypad; cinematic composition inspired by Wes Anderson symmetry and Spielberg warmth with Black Mirror unease; soft film grain, 35mm analog color, shallow depth of field, rim-lit by amber sodium lamps and teal neon; faint steam, light drizzle, reflective puddles; expression thoughtful, almost conspiratorial, portrait-style social-media realism, photorealistic, editorial mood, soft bokeh highlights cinematic color grading subtle facial scars visible.
