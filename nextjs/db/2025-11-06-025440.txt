Korean man, 34, medium-close portrait in damp neon alley at twilight, wearing a salt-stained olive mechanic's jumpsuit and a battered leather shoulder harness. He cradles a pulsing palm-sized quantum pollinator: brass-laced, glass core, soft blue corona, tiny rotors idling. Moody cinematic framing inspired by Wes Anderson's symmetry and Black Mirror's uncanny tech, Spielberg warmth in expression. Shallow depth of field, analog film grain, Kodak Portra tones, warm highlights, cool shadows. Natural side-light from a flickering streetpanel, light rain, reflection on wet asphalt. Pose relaxed, eyes averted, half-smile, social-media candid but deliberately staged, photorealistic, 35mm prime intimacy, subtle urban futurism aesthetic.
