Korean man, post-industrial serenity setting: derelict cranes repurposed as vertical glass orchards, their steel arms draped in moss and climbing vines. World element: suspended rusted catwalks threaded with slow vapor and dangling seedpods. Occupation: salvage engineer. Action/composition: mid-shot, adjusting a brass wrench on a moss-covered hoist, profile turned away from camera, eyes on machinery. Artistic style: surrealism inspired by Tarkovsky, cinematic analog film photography, soft grain, muted teals and warm sepia highlights, shallow depth of field, dramatic backlit fog, intimate, tactile, photorealistic, an uncanny domestic melancholy in reclaimed industry, subtle lens flares, scratched film edges, lingering bokeh, tactile corrosion details.
