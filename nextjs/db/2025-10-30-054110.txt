Korean man in his mid-40s stands in a post-industrial serenity loft, cradling a small bioluminescent mechanical sparrow against a backdrop of hanging glass terrariums and rusted steel girders. He wears a worn leather duster over a charcoal turtleneck, hands ink-stained, eyes softened by quiet wonder.

Cinematic, Tarkovsky-inspired realism fused with subtle James Cameron sci-fi detailing, muted earthy palette punctuated by the sparrow's gentle aqua glow, photorealistic, tactile textures. evocative contemplative atmosphere overall.
