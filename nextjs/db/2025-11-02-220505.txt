Korean man, 42, in a faded 1970s leather jacket, stands at a foggy mountaintop highway rest stop cluttered with stacked CRT televisions and neon gas pumps, holding a warm cassette Walkman. He faces three-quarter profile, looking toward a distant monorail arc, cigarette smoke curling; social-feed candid vibe, shallow depth of field, film grain, Polaroid-toned color. Golden hour drizzle, muted pastel sky. Cinematic framing inspired by Wes Anderson symmetry and Spielberg warmth with Black Mirror unease. Photorealistic analog 35mm portrait, medium-close shot, textured film, high dynamic range, subtle lens flare, uncanny everyday futurism, urban relics glow like slow mechanical constellations quiet.
