Korean man, 38, weathered navy trench coat and thin metallic scarf, stands in a robotic urbanity skyline, neon drones reflected in wet glass. He presses his palm to a rain-streaked window, medium close-up, gaze off-camera, city lights smearing into neon drone trails. Photorealistic analog 35mm: soft film grain, warm halation, shallow depth of field, muted teal and amber palette. Neo-noir cinematic style inspired by Tarkovsky stillness and Ridley Scott urban sheen, careful composition, strong rim-lighting, subtle motion blur from passing drones, tactile textures, plausible future tech, intimate human presence amid mechanical city, muted rain-slick reflections, cinematic loneliness and quiet resolve.
