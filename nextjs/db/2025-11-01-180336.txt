Korean man, 45-year-old watchmaker in a faded tweed suit, medium close-up in a retro alternative 1960s streetscape: mustard storefronts and rounded chrome bus stops. He adjusts a miniature clockwork zeppelin — a brass airship the size of a pocket watch — its tiny propellers turning. Overhead, rows of vintage vinyl-shaped drones hum like a midcentury traffic. Composition is Wes Anderson-inspired: symmetrical framing, saturated pastel palette, meticulous props, shallow depth of field, warm analog film grain. Photorealistic, slightly surreal, warm tungsten highlights and rich shadows, intimate focused portrait with hands and mechanism in sharp detail, cinematic still. soft window light nostalgically.
