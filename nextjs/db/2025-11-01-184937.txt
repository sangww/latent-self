Korean man in a robot modern home, a surrealist photoreal analog photograph: mid-shot of a man in a faded wool cardigan and suspenders, 50s, tinkering with a pocket-sized brass mechanical heart on a teak table, not facing the camera, warm late-afternoon sunlight filtered through glass vacuum tubes that circulate glowing oil, walls lined with quiet domestic automatons and tidy tool racks, composition inspired by Wes Anderson symmetry with Spielberg warmth, soft film grain, rich pastel palette, slightly exaggerated color grading, shallow depth of field, tactile surfaces, delicate dust motes, contemplative, intimate, uncanny domesticity, nostalgic mechanical details hint at everyday futurism.
