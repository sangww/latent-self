A middle-aged Korean man with salt-and-pepper hair and glasses stands in a vintage, retro-futuristic cityscape, illuminated by neon signs and floating holographic advertisements. He wears a well-tailored, dark leather jacket over a crisp white shirt, paired with high-waisted trousers. His expression is contemplative, gazing off to the side as if pondering the implications of a recent technological advancementâ€”a portable AI device hovering beside him, projecting a holographic map. The focus is on his upper body, captured in soft, diffused lighting that enhances the warm textures of the scene, with a slight grain reminiscent of 1970s film photography.
