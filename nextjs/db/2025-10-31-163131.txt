Korean man, post-industrial serenity: a retired steelworker in his late fifties wearing a patched leather apron and soot-streaked denim, sitting in a sunlit rail-yard greenhouse built from salvaged factory windows. He cradles a miniature bonsai forged from twisted steel and rusted wire, inspecting a delicate new leaf. Medium close-up, three-quarter profile, camera lens soft with film grain, warm backlight through cracked panes, shallow depth of field revealing blurred conveyor remnants and wild grass. Photorealistic analog photography, Tarkovsky-inspired cinematic realism, muted earthy palette with occasional teal pops, quiet, contemplative mood, precise texture and tactile detail, timeless resilience captured in soft focus.
