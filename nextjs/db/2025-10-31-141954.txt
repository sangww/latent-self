Korean man in a post-industrial serenity rooftop, surrounded by slow-rotating, tethered industrial drones repurposed as windharvesters. He is a 45-year-old maintenance foreman in an oil-stained canvas jacket and grease-streaked hands. Medium closeup, three-quarter profile, side-lit by late golden hour, fingers curled around a battered brass key, eyes focused off-frame. Photorealistic analog film grain, high dynamic range, shallow depth of field, muted earthy palette with a single saturated teal accent. Surrealism with Tarkovskian stillness, cinematic composition, precise symmetry, tactile textures, quiet tension. subtle rain streaks on glass. 35mm Kodak Portra warmth, soft flares, grainy edges, low-angle lens, slow shutter, natural vignette.
