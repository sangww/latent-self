Korean man in a post-industrial setting, medium close-up, wearing a weathered leather jacket and oil-streaked mechanic's shirt, age 38. He cradles a brass, clockwork koi—an intricate mechanical fish with steam vents and flickering bioluminescent scales—over a shallow rusted basin. Composition: side profile, eyes on the fish, shallow depth of field, soot-speckled light through broken skylight. Photorealistic analog film photograph, muted teal and amber palette, high grain, slight light leaks. Surrealist, Tarkovsky-inspired mood: quiet, uncanny, contemplative. Cinematic framing, soft focus background of hulking factories and hanging cables. Warm halation highlights worn hands, grease fingerprints, subtle reflections in brass scales, distant sirens.
