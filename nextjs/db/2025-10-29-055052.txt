Korean man, age 45, wearing a mustard turtleneck and worn suede blazer, sits in a retro 1970s living room, cradling a floating lava-lamp orb containing a miniature storm; mid-shot, slightly turned away from camera, soft film grain, warm saturated palette, heavy symmetry, vintage wallpaper and teak furniture blurred shallow depth of field, analog 35mm aesthetic, cinematic retro-surrealism inspired by Wes Anderson, precise framing, playful melancholy, rim lighting on face, subtle dust and light leaks, photorealistic textures, tactile fabric details, high dynamic range, quiet domestic otherworldliness, muted teal curtains, chrome ashtray reflections, distant record player softly spinning, gentle aperture vignette, timeless.
