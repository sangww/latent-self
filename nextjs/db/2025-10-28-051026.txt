Korean man, late 30s, close-up upper body, turned three-quarters away from camera, soft stubble, ash-brown hair, wearing a vintage brown leather jacket over a ribbed turtleneck, in an alternate near-future Seoul rooftop at dusk with neon haze. Surreal element: small mechanical moths embedded in his skin, gently fluttering through translucent clockwork cavities â€” emphasize: floating mechanical moths emerging from pores. He holds a cigarette between fingers, eyes distant. Analog retro film aesthetic: 1970s 50mm, shallow depth of field, warm grain, light leaks, muted colors, cinematic rim light, naturalistic shadows, photorealistic texture, Instagram-friendly composition, soft bokeh, subtle lens flare, honest mood.
