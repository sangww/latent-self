Korean man in his early 40s, medium close-up, sitting at the window of a decaying roadside diner converted into a solar-charged observatory, vintage 1970s windbreaker, hands on a small analog wrist device that projects folded paper maps, eyes turned away from the lens. Golden-hour rain outside, wet neon reflections on laminate table. Social-media candid aesthetic meets Wes Anderson symmetry and Spielberg warmth, subtle Black Mirror unease in concept. Film grain, expired Kodachrome palette, shallow depth, soft flares, natural window light, meticulous composition, slightly off-center framing, cinematic color grading and tactile analog imperfection for photorealistic, speculative still. quiet, intimate nostalgic mood.
