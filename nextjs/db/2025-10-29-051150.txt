Korean man in a post-industrial pastoral scene, medium-close portrait beside a half-buried rusting locomotive emerging from wildflower meadow. He wears a patched denim chore coat, age 35-45, tousled hair, wind-rough hands resting on the locomotive's horn. Golden-hour rim light and film grain, analog 35mm aesthetic, shallow depth of field, subtle lens flare. Composition slightly off-center, looking off-frame with quiet resolve. Surrealist cinematic mood, Tarkovsky-like long take feeling fused with precise color symmetry, muted greens and warm ochres, tactile rust textures, dew on metal, distant silo silhouettesâ€”intimate, melancholic, vividly tangible. Shot on expired film stock, high contrast, quiet sonic suggestion, echoes.
