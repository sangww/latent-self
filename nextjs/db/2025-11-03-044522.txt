Korean man stands in a derelict seaside amusement arcade rooftop at golden hour, wearing a creased 1970s trench, mid-40s, holding a battered mechanical wrist-computer like an heirloom. Medium close-up, three-quarter profile, soft rain catching neon reflections; background shows retro-futuristic monorail and faded pastel billboards with slow-moving maintenance drones and a lone vintage scooter. Social-media candor meets surreal: small paper airplanes suspended mid-fall around him. Photorealistic analog Kodachrome feel, shallow depth, film grain, warm high-contrast tones, 50mm portrait lens, cinematic framing inspired by Wes Anderson’s symmetry, Spielberg’s wonder, Black Mirror’s uncanny calm. subtle vignette, intimate expression, captured like a lost postcard.
