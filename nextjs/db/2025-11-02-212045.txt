Korean man, mid-30s, medium close-up in a vertical social-story frame, seated on a cracked 1970s diner stool atop a moss-softened rooftop amid a retro-futuristic city. He wears a mustard corduroy jacket and white turtleneck, holding a warm Polaroid like a relic. Surreal detail: the Polaroid ejects a miniature paper skyline that floats a finger-length above his palm. Cinematic, nostalgic lighting, pastel tones, shallow depth of field, 35mm film grain, soft tungsten backlight, careful Wes Anderson symmetry with Spielberg warmth and Black Mirror unease. Natural skin texture, candid gaze off-camera, photorealistic analog photography, high dynamic range, vintage color grading, subtle flare.
