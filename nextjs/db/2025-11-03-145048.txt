Korean man in his early thirties, medium-close portrait, slight three-quarter profile, wearing a worn leather pilot jacket layered over a retro-futuristic knit, 1950s alt-history airfield fused with neon wind turbines behind him at golden hour. He's holding a weathered analog wrist console, smudged with oil and moss, a small mechanical fox curled on his gloved shoulder, wind tousling hair. Rain-smeared film aesthetic, editorial social-media vibe, cinematic color and symmetry inspired by Wes Anderson and Spielberg, with Black Mirror stillness. Photorealistic Kodak Portra tones, subtle film grain, shallow depth of field, crisp facial detail, soft backlight, candid, evocative quiet mechanical hum.
