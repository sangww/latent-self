Korean man in a post-industrial pastoral setting, clutching a rusted mechanical windmill terrarium. He is a 45-year-old wearing a faded denim chore jacket and olive linen shirt. Medium close-up, three-quarter profile, gaze off-camera, rim-lit by low golden hour sun and neon algae glow. Background: overgrown concrete silos, wildflowers threaded with copper piping, distant photovoltaic barn. Photorealistic analog film grain, muted teal-and-amber color grade, shallow depth of field. Surrealism with cinematic influence from Ridley Scott and Tarkovsky: contemplative, uncanny, tactile textures, careful composition, soft bokeh, subtle lens flare, bold but natural contrast. Warm hands, soil-stained fingernails, distant hum of old generators.
