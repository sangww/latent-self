Korean man in a post-apocalyptic street, medium close portrait, cradling a cracked glass jar containing a miniature bioluminescent pine forest — the single surreal relic — wearing a faded olive military jacket, age 48, hands stained with ash, face half-turned away. Photorealistic analog film look, shallow depth, warm tungsten highlights, grainy ISO texture, muted teal and amber palette. Composition inspired by Tarkovsky: long quiet melancholy, cinematic stillness, smoke curling in background ruins, fallen neon sign blurred bokeh. Close, intimate framing emphasizes weathered skin and glowing trees, balancing desolation and fragile wonder. subtle lens flare hints at distant sunrise and hope.
