Korean man in a retro-futurism street-lab setting, medium close-up, three-quarter profile, cradling an antique brass respirator filled with glowing aquamarine algae; he wears an olive velvet trench coat with luminescent copper piping and a faded silk scarf. Filmic warm Kodak Portra tones, subtle film grain, shallow depth of field, soft lens flares from neon signage behind him. Composition balances intimate portrait and industrial background, candid, not looking at camera. High-detail skin texture, reflective metal highlights, bioluminescent glow casting teal rim light. Neo-noir surrealism, Ridley Scott-inspired, photorealistic analog 35mm photograph, bold color contrast and cinematic framing. urban rain sheen and depth.
