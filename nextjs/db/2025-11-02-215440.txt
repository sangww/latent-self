Korean man, mid-40s, tailored retro-futuristic flight jacket, seated in a sunlit 1970s diner set on a flowering salt flat at golden hour, surreal detail: a stack of vintage CRT televisions reflecting static in his eyes, a small analog pager pinned to his lapel, cigarette smoke curling into miniature highway shapes, three-quarter profile, medium close-up, shallow depth of field, film grain, soft pastel palette, symmetrical composition, Wes Anderson framing with Spielberg warmth and Black Mirror unease, candid social-media portrait aesthetic, photorealistic analog print, crisp natural light, slightly desaturated, evocative and uncanny, subtle neon trim, faded motel signage, hands resting, silver ring.
