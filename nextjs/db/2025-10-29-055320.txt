Korean man, age 45, wearing a mustard corduroy suit and cream turtleneck, sits in a retro 1970s household living room, medium shot, cradling a levitating translucent vinyl record that glows amber and casts soft shadows; avocado-green wallpaper, teak shelves filled with analog gadgets, a chrome Sputnik lamp halo behind him. Photorealistic analog film look, warm grain, slight cross-processing, low-key cinematic lighting; composition balances symmetry and offbeat tilt, surreal yet domestic. Inspired by Wes Anderson retro-surrealism, tidy color palette, shallow depth-of-field, subtle lens flare, evocative texture, quiet uncanny mood. Soft bokeh highlights on edges, gentle film burn at frame corners, nostalgic.
