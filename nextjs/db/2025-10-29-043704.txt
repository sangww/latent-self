Korean man in a black mirror dystopia, medium shot, three-quarter profile, adjusting a cracked brass analog wristwatch that emits faint holographic city smog; he wears a patched olive mechanic's coverall threaded with warm amber LED seams; behind him, a rain-speckled vending kiosk dispenses glowing paper maps, neon reflections smear across wet asphalt; photographic style: retro-noir analog photography, Kodachrome grain, high-contrast color, cinematic lighting inspired by Ridley Scott and Tarkovsky, shallow depth of field, bold composition, tactile texture, slightly desaturated cyan-magenta palette. Soft rim light sculpts damp skin, visible pores and stubble, cracked watch glass, copper patina, slow shutter bokeh glow.
