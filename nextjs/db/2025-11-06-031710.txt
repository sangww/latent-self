Korean man in his early thirties, medium close-up, standing under a rain-slick neon overpass at twilight. He wears a patched leather bomber with embroidered circuitry, fingers adjusting a translucent ocular implant that projects faint alphanumeric dust. His pose is candid, half-turned, gaze off-frame, slight smirk; social-media selfie energy rendered like analog 35mm film with warm cross-processed tones, soft grain, shallow depth of field. Background shows a retro-futuristic tram and a hovering parcel drone docking at a lamppost. Lighting inspired by Wes Anderson symmetry, Spielberg glow, Black Mirror edge, cinematic, intimate, strangely everyday futurism. Shot like a late-night magazine portrait, authentic.
