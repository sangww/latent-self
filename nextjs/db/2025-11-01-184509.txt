Korean man, 50-year-old postal worker in a faded 1960s uniform, medium-close profile shot adjusting a brass respirator, a small clockwork fox perched on his shoulder, set in a retro alternative 1960s city street lined with visible steam pipes and pastel neon signs, a hovering analog dirigible in the sky, surrealist composition with symmetrical Wes Anderson-inspired framing, warm Kodachrome film tones, tactile film grain, shallow depth of field, high contrast, everyday oddity mood, photorealistic analog photography, meticulous costume detail, bold color accents and cinematic lighting, soft backlight rim, faint rain residue on uniform, cigarette smoke curl, subtle mechanical ticks almost audible.
