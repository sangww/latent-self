Korean man stands in a post-apocalyptic street beside a cracked neon glass phone booth transformed into a tiny greenhouse filled with bioluminescent moss and drifting pollen. Age 35-45, wearing a patched leather bomber jacket and threadbare knit sweater, medium shot, three-quarter profile, hands cradling a glowing moss cluster as if listening. Tarkovsky-inspired melancholic surrealism, cinematic analog photography: soft film grain, muted teal-and-amber palette, shallow depth of field, high dynamic range, long-lens compression. Composition balances gritty urban ruin and intimate human ritual, subtle lens flare from fractured neon, natural light mixing with artificial glow, evocative and quietly strange. timeless uncanny warmth.
