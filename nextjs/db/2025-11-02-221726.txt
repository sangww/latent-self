Korean man in his early 40s, medium close-up at dusk on an abandoned 1970s coastal highway rest stop, wearing a worn leather bomber and patterned shirt, holding a cracked portable cassette player whose tape reads handwritten coordinates. Neon gas-pump signs flicker, rusted pay phones stacked like sculptures, a small autonomous delivery rover waits beside him. Rain-slick asphalt reflects twin moons in the sky — subtly impossible. Cinematic palette: Wes Anderson symmetry, Spielberg warmth, Black Mirror unease. Analog film look, Portra tones, shallow depth of field, soft tungsten rim light, visible grain, candid social-media portrait vibe, off-center composition, not looking at viewer.
