Korean man, post-modern minimalistic street where skyscrapers are constructed from interlocking clockwork gears, world softened by a thin perpetual dusk. He is a 48-year-old bicycle courier in a worn leather jacket and fluorescent armband, medium shot, three-quarter profile, reaching up toward a brass pocket watch embedded in a streetlamp. Photorealistic analog film grain, shallow depth of field, warm backlight rim lighting, muted pastel palette with a pop of mustard and teal. Surrealism inspired by Wes Anderson symmetry and Spielberg warmth, bold composition, slightly off-kilter perspective, intimate, everyday-strange, cinematic realism. soft film flare, neon reflections, slow shutter ghosting of distant bicycles.
