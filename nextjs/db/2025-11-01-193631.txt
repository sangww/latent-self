Korean man in his thirties, wearing faded mechanic coveralls, stands in a robot modern home kitchen. He adjusts a small clockwork tea kettle with brass gears while retro domestic robots with analog dials line the glossy shelves. Medium close-up, three-quarter profile, shallow depth of field, soft tungsten rim light and Kodak film grain. Surrealism infused with Wes Anderson symmetry and Black Mirror stillness: ordinary domesticity twisted into quiet uncanny detail. Warm saturated colors, precise composition, tactile metal textures, subtle reflections on chrome, natural window light falling like a rectangle on his shoulder, cinematic, photorealistic analog photograph. soft editorial film processing.
