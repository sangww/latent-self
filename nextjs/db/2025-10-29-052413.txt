Korean man, 38, wearing a worn leather jacket and tailored reflective scarf, in an extraterrestrial saltflat at dusk, cradling a levitating bioluminescent geode orb against his chest, medium close-up, three-quarter profile looking past the frame. Background: low purple dunes and distant chrome monoliths, fine film grain, Kodachrome-like warmth, shallow depth of field, rim light halo from the orb, subtle lens flares. Surrealist-cinematic mood inspired by Tarkovsky and Ridley Scott: quiet, uncanny, meticulously composed. Photorealistic analog photograph with bold color contrast, tactile texture, and melancholic, contemplative atmosphere. Soft wind lifts stray hair; the orb emits faint harmonic ripples, casting ghostly reflections.
