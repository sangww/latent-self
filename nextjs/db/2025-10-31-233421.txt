Korean man stands in a post modern city street, medium close up three quarter profile, plucking a suspended Polaroid from the air; buildings stacked like brutalist tapestries, neon signs softened by film grain. He is aged 42, an urban planner wearing a rumpled beige trench coat and leather satchel, cigarette between fingers, expression pensive. The city contains frozen moments, actual photographs drifting like paper satellites, each showing a different day, casting soft reflections on chrome. Photorealistic photography, Kodak Portra tones, shallow depth of field, symmetrical composition, surrealism with Wes Anderson color palette and contemplative stillness, teal highlights, warm amber shadows.
