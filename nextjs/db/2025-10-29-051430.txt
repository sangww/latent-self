Korean man in an ubertechnological urban landscape, medium closeup three-quarter profile adjusting a cracked vintage film camera fused with a translucent holographic interface; rain-slick street reflections and neon puddles shimmer behind him, holographic storefronts and towering chrome facades recede into bokeh. He is 35, wearing a weathered tailored trench coat with subtle LED piping and a faded silk scarf. Photorealistic analog film grain, high contrast color palette, dramatic rim lighting, cinematic neo-noir photorealism inspired by Ridley Scott and Wong Kar-wai; intimate, slightly surreal composition, bold neon hues, tactile textures. shallow depth of field, subtle motion blur. warm cigarette smoke curling.
