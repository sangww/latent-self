Korean man, 38, medium closeup in a foggy seaside amusement motel at dawn, wearing a faded 1970s flight jacket and knit scarf, adjusting a brass mechanical wristwatch. Social-media style candid: soft smile, gaze off-frame, film grain, shallow depth of field. Background: cracked CRT television on a balcony, retro neon sign half-drowned in mist, cassette player clipped to his belt. Surreal detail: the watch face reflects a cramped metropolis at sunset instead of his hand. Cinematic palette mixing Wes Anderson symmetry, Spielbergic warmth and Black Mirror unease, cross-processed 35mm tones, gentle drizzle, golden-pink pre-dawn light, natural imperfections, spontaneous framing, imperfect colors.
